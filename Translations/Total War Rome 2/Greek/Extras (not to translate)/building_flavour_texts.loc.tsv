"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Amphitheatre_flavour"	"The word amphitheatre means 'a theatre on both sides' and they developed from Greek circular theatres as venues for open air entertainment. Used for the richer members of the audience to show off to lesser folk, and to celebrate religious festivals, an amphitheatre's main purpose was as an arena for gladiatorial games. Blood became the staple entertainment of the Roman people. Every corner of the Empire from Britain to Syria had its amphitheatres, ranging in size from small wooden structures to the great Colosseum in Rome. Here the plebeians could be entertained, and watch gladiators demonstrating the Roman virtues of courage and fortitude, and enjoy the bloodlust, spectacle and cruelty. Amphitheatres were also important to the social order: events were often free, paid for by patrician aristocrats, the wealthy, and Emperors, all hoping for public support."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_dk_saba_marib_flavour"	"The Great Dam of Marib - just outside the Sabaean city that shares its name - was one of the grandest engineering marvels of the ancient world. From the 8th century BC until the 5th or 6th century AD, the Great Dam sustained life in the desert around Marib, the largest city in ancient southern Arabia. First constructed to catch rainwater during the monsoon for irrigation purposes, the dam was modified in height and breadth over many centuries. However, this weakened the structure, leading to more frequent breaches that were more difficult to repair on each subsequent occasion. The dam has remained unrepaired since late in the 6th century AD; it is thought that the cost of repairs was too great following the collapse of the Himyarite Kingdom earlier in the century. This state of affairs led to the mass-migration of around 50,000 people who were living in the Dhana Valley - a great movement of people by the standards of the time, and something that even warranted a mention in the Quran."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Port_flavour"	"Many ancient civilisations relied on naval power, both mercantile and military, to maintain their empires. At its height, the Seleucid Empire reached the Persian Gulf, the Caspian Sea, and the Mediterranean, where its trade influence spread into the Black Sea beyond. Closer to home, fish were a vital food resource for many cultures, supplementing agriculture especially in arid coastal regions. In comparison to the dangers of drought and flood that could destroy crops, fish were a resource that could be relied upon whatever the weather."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Fountains_flavour"	"Fountains and pools were often centrepieces in courtyards and gardens, a display of power and wealth in Carthage. Functional as well as decorative, they provided water and natural cooling in the desert heat. Fountains and cisterns also provided the water essential for ritual ablutions, necessary for the worship of the gods. Wells, springs and waterways would channel water to fill enclosed cisterns, which were designed to reduce water loss from evaporation, and these would then feed fountains by gravity."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Panhellenic_games_flavour"	"The Olympiad was a four year calendar cycle in Hellenistic culture marked by a series of four religious festivals. All the city-states and colonies came together to celebrate their culture, and engage in sporting contests. Foot and chariot races, javelin and discus throwing, wrestling and boxing were included. The Olympics in Elis  were the biggest festival, and honoured Zeus, the king of the gods Zeus, as did the Nemean games. Other gods were honoured with their own games: Poseidon had the Isthmian games in Corinth, while Apollo was celebrated by the Pythian games at Delphi. Despite the bellicose relationships between some states peace was declared during the festivals. The victors were rewarded only with garlands and wreaths."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Farm_flavour"	"Agriculture in dry climes was and remains a difficult endeavour. Water and its proper use are the crucial factors: rivers and flood plains might be good for growing crops, but a flood can wash away good soil instead of renewing the land. In more arid areas, farmers are reliant on canals and qanats for irrigation, and water must be managed carefully. Good farmland is often at a premium. Farms produced wheat, barley, olives and wine, as well enabled the husbandry of cattle, goats and sheep. Despite apparently unpromising land, many eastern states, including Parthia and Persia, had a strong agricultural base."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Shrine_of_astarte_flavour"	"Astarte was a complicated, warlike goddess and worshipped by soldiers and couples for her influence over war and love. She was most commonly depicted symbolically by a star within a circle representing the Evening Star, the planet Venus. Several creatures were also considered sacred to her, including the lion, horse and sphinx. In Carthage she was considered to have a separate role from Tanit but there was some overlap in their responsibilities. Astarte is most famously depicted as an alabaster figurine known as the 'Lady of Galera'. This small statuette is seated on a throne and flanked by sphinxes. She holds a bowl that can be filled from liquid that pours out of her breasts. An ancient Ugarit goddess worshipped by the Phoenicians, Astarte was equated to Artemis and Aphrodite by the Greeks and to Venus by the Romans."	"True"

Slaves were bought and traded in every town and city, their status the result of wars, kidnap, birth, poverty, or criminality. From fields to the mightiest of temples, slavery was the engine that drove everything. Interestingly, no group, nationality or tribe was considered to be automatically worthy of enslavement. Misfortune could be visited equally on almost anyone. Slaves were rarely used in battle, and so the image of slaves chained to the oars of warships is largely a product of Hollywood cinema history.

More than prostitutes, however, these women were the very definition of 'sophistication'. They were educated companions as opposed to objects for sex; Hetaira had influence, paid taxes and were the only females able to attend the symposia and have opinions that were to be respected - unusual in such a male-dominated world. During the Peloponnesian War, one of the most famous Hetaira was Lais of Korinthos, who was regarded as the most beautiful woman in the known world in her day. Her clients included the Olympic champion Eubotas and the philosopher Aristippus, whose philosophies were fittingly concerned with encouraging people to seek pleasure."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Shieldmaker_flavour"	"The shield was the most important piece of armour to a Greek infantryman. The hoplon not only gave the hoplites their name but also led to the creation of the phalanx, a supremely effective fighting formation. The concave, circular hoplon was made of bronze and wood with leather strapping for the hoplite's arm. It was of similar size to many previous designs but its unique grip allowed troops to stand close and cover the next man, thus forming a solid, unyielding wall: the phalanx. The hoplon was used throughout the Hellenistic world. It was a terrible dishonour to lose a shield in battle as it was the hoplite’s talisman and symbol of being part of the greater army of his city-state."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_east_wrestlers"	"Wrestling is a very old sport popular in Persian, Indian and Hellenic cultures, although rules and styles do vary. Bouts could be held almost anywhere, but as the sport developed specialist arenas with earth or sand floors and galleries for spectators became popular. One of the earliest depictions is a Neolithic cave painting from the Bayankhongor Province of Mongolia showing two naked men wrestling and watched by onlookers. Centuries later, Greek wrestling became popular as part of the ancient Olympiad, was taken across the ancient world by Alexander and his armies, and eventually absorbed into Roman culture."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Training_field_flavour"	"As warfare developed tactics became more organised and required disciplined training to carry out. The phalanx of hoplites was among the most intimidating battle formations: troops were trained to hold out their sarissas, or long pikes, between their overlapping hoplon shields to create an impenetrable wall. The massed ranks behind the front line added weight to the attack. Hellenistic armies used this traditional Greek tactic to great effect. In time, the phalanx developed from a manoeuvrable formation to a massive unit that could overrun anything that stood in its way. Providing its flanks were protected, and on flat ground, the phalanx was hugely effective. It could be used as the main line of attack or to lock the enemy in position while the cavalry swept round to attack the flanks and rear. However, on rough terrain or when the wings or rear of the phalanx were exposed, it proved somewhat unwieldy and vulnerable."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_dk_saba_shams_flavour"	"Shams was the southern Arabian goddess of the sun, also worshipped as a preserver of the crops and domestic life. In addition, she was a goddess of justice, as she could see all human actions and expose injustice with her light. Oaths were often sworn in Shams' name, for she would know if they were made in bad faith. Worship of the sun goddess was performed by bowing to the east and praying at sunrise, noon and sunset and through other rituals performed in the open air or within one of her temples. It is likely that Shams was an aspect of the Mesopotamian god, Shapash or Shamash, later worshipped by the Himyarites - another short-lived Arabian kingdom that sprung up around 100BC - and the region's nomadic Bedouin tribes for centuries."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Loremasters_hut_flavour"	"Little is known for certain of the ways and practices of the ancient druids. Classical writers stated that these mysterious men refused to write their secrets down, preferring to pass their knowledge from generation to generation orally. The writer Diodorus Siculus was the first to discuss the idea that there were distinct roles within the druid system, and it was Strabo who divided these into three separate classes; those who studied moral philosophy were known as the 'druidai'; the diviners and specialists in the natural world were the 'o'vateis'; and the poets and singers were the 'bardoi'. The bardoi, or bards, were responsible for passing on history in poetry and song. History always included the brave deeds of warriors as well as knowledge of the gods and the natural world."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Bronze_workshop_flavour"	"Due to the tribal practice of making votive offerings to gods of rivers and waterways, many bronze artifacts have been discovered at the bottom of lakes and rivers all over Europe. The River Thames in London, England must have held particular significance to the local tribes as a number of bronze work pieces have been discovered on the bottom over the years. The Waterloo Helmet, a ceremonial piece with two horns, was discovered in 1868, and the Wandsworth and Battersea shields were also recovered from the river and now reside in the British Museum. Like the helmet, the Battersea Shield is thought to be a ceremonial piece as there is no evidence of damage and no sign that it was ever attached to a wooden base, which would have given it the strength it required to be battle ready."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Heavy_horse_studs_flavour"	"Eastern cavalry had both Hellenistic and Persian influences, with the more easterly states favouring cataphract-style scale armour, in the Parthian fashion, protecting both rider and horse. As a result, the Seleucid kings that followed Alexander maintained two 1,000-man units of elite cavalry, the Hetairoi, modelled on Parthian cataphracts. Following the Alexandrian and Parthian examples, heavy cavalry were a hammer in the tactical toolbox of eastern generals, driving off their opposite numbers before outflanking and exploiting vulnerable infantry flanks. This was helped by the use of a wedge formation to drive into the enemy and break their ordered lines."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_barb_craftsmen"	"Isolating a single form of ‘barbarian’ art in this period is nearly impossible. In a time distinguished by frequent population movements, conquests, and new trade, ideas spread and fused rapidly to create new visual styles. The Celts, for example, were actually the largest producers of Roman style pottery in the ancient world and, likewise, the abstract animal patterns that are considered typically Celtic actually originated with the Germans. However, most barbarian art was united by its focus on geometric patterns and rejection of narrative and figurative depiction."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_City_flavour"	"The cities of the ancient world were situated where resources were plentiful and could be defended. River crossings, ports and natural trade routes were ideal locations for large populations to arise. Cities developed over long periods of time, often incorporating the architecture of earlier civilisations. In 305BC, the city of Seleucia vastly expanded an existing town on the west bank of the Tigris River. In the centuries that followed it came to rival the great Hellenic cities in magnificence. Often, planned expansion was limited to high-status quarters of the city: palaces, temples and public areas. Everyone else squeezed into the available space within the walls. This led to magnificent buildings being only a stone's throw from squalid slums."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Nobles_quarters_flavour"	"Elite infantry had a prominent role in the ancient world, often as noble companions and royal guards. Alexander’s successors had the agema and hypaspists, such as the Silver Shields who served until they were almost too old to fight. The Seleucid Empire founded its own Silver Shields, but these were an elite unit of phalangites. Over time, these elite units became professional and some, such as the nobles and mercenaries protecting the Parthian King of Kings, became royal guards living within the palace. Royal guards were not, however, always bound by tradition: the Seleucid ruler, Antiochus IV, retrained some 5,000 Silver Shields to fight in the 'Roman fashion' as legionaries."	"True"

Not unlike other Germanic tribes, during times of war the Gothi were led by a king holding the title 'reiks'. Famously, Reiks Cniva led crossed the Danube into Roman territory in AD 250, sacked the Roman city of Philippopolis, and slew the Emperor Decius at the Battle of Abritus. Reeling from the shock of this defeat, the Romans allowed Cniva to withdraw northwards and paid him tribute in the hope of preventing future Gothic invasions. As success of a marauding barbarian king was measured chiefly by the amount of loot he secured, one can easily imagine that Cniva's prestige and authority grew immensely from this point onwards."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_palmyra_citycentre_GreatColonnade"	"The main street of Palmyra was a massive architectural undertaking built over the course of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. A magnificent forest of columns and arches, it ran from the city's western gate to the temple of Bel in the south-eastern quarter. Funds for the construction of later known as the 'Great Colonnade of Palmyra' came from wealthy individuals and trading guilds, who in fact bought the right to place a statue of themselves along with an inscription on a column of their choosing. Emperor Septimius Severus contributed to the project by building a special arch there to commemorate his triumph over the Parthians. The Great Colonnade became the axis around which the Palmyra's everyday life spun; shops and markets were spread around the columns along with theatres, baths, monuments and temples, where believers flocked for rituals and prayer."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_grain_chain"	"Along with water, food is one of the basic human needs. When a population’s staple diet is bread, being able to effectively manage its production is an essential skill. In the ancient world, common threats such as warfare, flooding or drought could ruin a harvest. By storing excess grain from successful harvests a nation not only ensured its own safety, but also enabled it to assist others – making grain a powerful diplomatic tool. Consequently, control of its granaries was often the issue at the centre of internal power struggles. This is vividly demonstrated by the discovery of model granaries buried along with their owners to demonstrate the deceased’s agricultural power."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Water_canals_flavour"	"Canals were a common feature of regions without major waterways or where the annual flow was insufficient to supply farms and communities with the water needed to sustain life. Whatever the source, water often needed to be carried great distances to reach the people, animals and farmland that depended on it. As a precious commodity in hot climates, water control was a matter of vital importance. Reservoirs were used to store water for particularly dry times. Eventually, sophisticated water channelling systems were developed and carefully graded to manage flow. Once the water had reached its destination, sluices directed the water to the surrounding farms."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_dk_minor_spice"	"In ancient times, the kingdoms of southern Arabia and the Horn of Africa were the major suppliers of frankincense to the Mediterranean world. The so-called ‘Incense Route’ started in the southernmost part of the Arabian Peninsula, in a region known to the Greeks as ‘Eudaemon Arabia’ (‘Elevated Arabia’), beginning in Marib and Gherrea and passing through Qataban and Ma'in before reaching Nabataean Petra and beyond. It also served as a connection between India and the Mediterranean super-powers. Trade along the route was very lucrative and Arabia flourished as a result, with some of its cities becoming extremely wealthy in the process. Unfortunately, with success, envy follows inevitably, and so the Arabian cities became targets for many great conquerors, including Alexander. However, no one managed to capture them during their heyday, although most eventually fell to other powers by the end of the 2nd century BC, with the discovery of a direct sea route to India. Once Greeks and Romans began to bypass its land routes, southern Arabia’s wealth and power slowly but steadily declined. The Kingdom of Saba was one of the first to collapse, giving way to the Himyarite Kingdom, while Nabataea lasted longer through Hellenisation and alliance with the burgeoning Roman Empire."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_germanic_Grove_of_thunaraz_flavour"	"Literally meaning thunder, Thunaraz was one of the gods of the sky. He is very similar to the Norse god Thor and governed storms. He was best known for his incredible strength and for wielding a heavy hammer in battle as he rode his chariot across the heavens. Thunaraz was not inclined to get involved with politics and the lives of men as Teiwaz and Wodanaz did, but was seen as a great protector. He was the most popular god among the common German people and was especially worshipped by farmers and rural folk who depended on his gifts of rain for good harvests. These farmers were also the warriors of a barbarian army in times of war, and Thunaraz in his aggressive ways was a great inspiration to them. His power was seen in its purest form in lightning: a magical force that struck from the sky with great destructive power. Today his name lives on in English as the fifth day of the week, Thursday."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Blacksmith_flavour"	"If one worker built both the ancient and modern worlds, it is the blacksmith. Tools of bronze and later iron enabled land to be cultivated, ships to be built, stone to be quarried, and wars to be fought with greater and more terrible savagery than ever before. Blacksmiths were ubiquitous: every village and town of note had a smithy turning out anything the community needed. Smithing also encouraged trade, as the tin needed for bronze was not always a local resource. This is what led the Phoenicians to sail all the way to distant Britain: they were looking for a reliable, and plentiful, source of tin. It was the move from bronze to iron that gave warriors an edge in combat, often quite literally. In the hands of a strong man, an iron sword could cleave through bronze armour and weaponry with suitably unfortunate results for its target."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_east_water_paradise_garden"	"The concept of a garden created for the purposes of aesthetic pleasure was present in Persian culture from the days of the Achaemenids and further developed by the Sassanid dynasty once they wrested control from the Parthians. Conceptually, the garden was a walled enclosure designed to please - the whole world in a bubble, where magnificent plant life flowered amidst sparkling fountains and one could walk along the winding pathways in search of solitude or relaxation. In Avestan, the language of the Zoroastrian holy scripture, the word for such a garden is 'pairidaeza', the origin of the English word 'paradise'. Thus, the Persians were able to create paradise on Earth with their own hands."	"True"

Trade along what would become the Silk and Spice roads began almost at the start of civilisation with the rise of farming and trade amongst Neolithic communities. It was not until Arab and Phoenician traders began trading spices and other luxury goods, such as gold, precious stones, silks and fine textiles, that fixed routes and markets began to appear. As well as spices to flavour foods, other items were traded, including those considered essential for religious rites, such as frankincense. Traded for over 5,000 years, this tree resin gives off a strong aroma when burned. Myrrh was also valued for its uses as a medicine and for embalming mummies."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_lumber_chain"	"Wood has been a staple of life and trade for as long as humans have cut down trees. In the ancient world wood and charcoal were the foremost fuels, with timber also being used extensively in construction, transport, warfare, furniture-making and even the arts. The early design of mortise and tenon joinery was found in Egyptian furniture from 2500BC and spread throughout Europe and the Middle East. Although stone was used in many advanced cultures for construction, wood remained the basic building block for many peoples. Nothing surpassed it if you wanted to go to sea. Boat and ship building developed throughout the ages and timber supplies were crucial when establishing a navy."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Fishing_Port_flavour"	"Seafood has always been important around the Mediterranean. The sea could be guaranteed to feed everyone even when crops failed. Fish was also important to the Romans for garum, a fish sauce that they added to many meals to give them extra pep and flavour. Garum, however, may not sound all that appetising to many modern diners: it was made from the salted intestines of fish, left to ferment for many months. The exact flavour of a particular garum depended on the fish used, and the herbs added during fermentation and bottling in amphorae. The varied and flavoursome garum trade was actually quite widespread and important in the Roman world. Troops expected garum to be available to season their food, even if they were on duty in far Britannia! As well as being a tasty, if not essential, addition to Roman meals, garum was also used as a medicine for all kinds of problems although, given the chief ingredients, it was probably most used as a cure for constipation! Even so, garum was not universally liked: Seneca, the Roman stoic philosopher, hated the filthy stuff even though his family came from a garum-making region of Hispania."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Grove_of_Papaios_flavour"	"For the Scythians, Papaios was a father figure, and the king of the gods. As might be expected of a Greek writer, Herodotus immediately recasts him in the image of Zeus, and with much the same responsibilities and powers. This 'explaining the world in Greek terms' was a piece of cultural chauvinism, but gives us our only real insight into the Scythian pantheon by a contemporary observer. As with the other gods, Papaios was honoured by sacrifices, with offerings of horses being particularly highly regarded. For steppe nomads, who lived and died by their ability to travel, such offerings must have been genuine and heart-felt sacrifices, and not simply for form’s sake. The widespread use of horses in sacrifices by many peoples across Europe suggests that this type of offering was very ancient indeed, and probably predated any tribe or group that could be called 'Scythian'."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_dacian_kotys_flavour"	"Kotys was the Thracian goddess of war and slaughter. Unlike some other gods of battle, Kotys was celebrated with an explosion of riotous festivals. These festivals were known as Cottyttia, and involved nights of hedonistic behaviour, such as huge orgies. They were originally practised in secret because of their notorious obscenity. Strabo speaks of these festivals and their music, with drummers beating out a heavy cadence and 'shrill cries' from stringed instruments, creating a 'terrifying sound'. These revelries were first intended to commemorate the rape of Persephone, an event in Greek mythology where the goddess of vegetation was kidnapped by Hades and taken to the underworld. There is some indication that the Hellenisation of Kotys meant her worship as far west as Magna Graecia and Sicily. Those who followed Kotys were known as Baptes, or 'washers', as they washed themselves thoroughly in a ritual of purification before beginning the Cottyttia."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Commons_flavour"	"Barbarian settlements were just as carefully laid out as any Roman or Greek city. They had clearly defined streets, areas for craftsmen to work, cattle pens and common land for use by the whole tribe. One of the best preserved examples of a Celtic village can be found In Chysauster in Cornwall, England. Here, the homesteads are built around an internal courtyard that has given them the name 'courtyard houses'. This particular style of homestead is only found on the Land's End peninsular and the Isles of Scilly. The eight remaining structures are clearly clustered along a street, and the paving stones survive to this day. As well as the houses, this settlement has an incredibly well preserved 'fogou', or 'souterrain', an underground chamber used for food storage."	"True"

These slums of the ancient world often came to be due to a sudden influx of outsiders. The newcomers either tried to find their luck in the city or simply sought safety, but many of them faced a life of poverty and misery instead. Ramshackle buildings stood along intertwining alleyways, where muggers lurked at night waiting to pounce on their sorry victims. ‘Proper’ folk, especially the very rich ones, usually avoided such places and would probably not dare visit them without the company of loyal attendants."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_thracian_zibelthiurdos_flavour"	"Little is known about Zibelthiurdos. However, it is thought that he was the Thracian god of storms, who sent thunder and lightning from the heavens down to the earth. Like many Thracian deities there are parallels with the Greek pantheon, in this case most notably Zeus. Zeus was the king of the gods, and was also worshipped for harnessing the power of the sky and thunder. It’s also possible to link Zibelthiurdos to the Celtic god of thunder, Taranis, as there is an etymological connection between the two. Both gods were believed to personify the elements; 'thiurd' meaning to 'push' or 'crash down' in Thracian, and the word ‘toranos’ meaning 'thunder', from which Taranis is derived. It is possible that the Thracians worshipped the god of the storm as one of the 'Thracian Hero' gods, along with Zalmoxis and Gebeleizis."	"True"

In fact, the Latin word 'templum' actually refers not to a building but to a sacred outdoor space, where a religious structure might be constructed. Maintaining good relations with the gods was an essential part of everyday life for people who had a different god watching over them for every given circumstance. There were shrines in every home and community, and consecrated grounds such as springs, groves and temples were found everywhere. Up to a third of the official Roman year was dedicated to celebrating religious festivals, so shrines were well-used spaces. They were considered so important that to desecrate such places was a sacrilege punishable by death."	"True"

Aligned with Odin in Norse mythology, he was the foremost of the Aesir and a complicated deity. Son of giants, he presided over wisdom, philosophy, art and poetry. He sacrificed himself to himself by hanging, dangling from the World Tree for nine days and nine nights. His reward was the learning of powerful songs and the 24 runes of power. He also attained great knowledge by giving up one of his eyes in return for a drink from the Well of Wisdom.

Cartimandua, queen of the Briganti tribe in Britannia, chose to ally herself with Rome after witnessing the devastation of the southern British tribes. Fleeing for his life, the leader of the Catuvellauni tribe, Caratacus, sought refuge with Cartimandua. Rather than break her alliance with Rome she gave up Caratacus to the Romans in chains.

Performed as a way to offer tribute to the gods, the bodies of those animals deemed most appropriate were given up to the deity. Naturally, the animal in question differed depending on the god or goddess in question. Endovelicus, generally recognised as the head of the Iberian pantheon, was said to primarily receive pigs as sacrifice. On the other hand Neto, the god of war, was associated with the bull, so they may have been offered for sacrifice to him.

One mythological tale saw Hera cast Hephaestus from Olympus because he was lame, whilst others state he was made lame by his fall from the mountain. Either way, Hephaestus was also known as "the lame one", despite his prodigious smithing skills.

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_illyrian_thana_flavour"	"Thana is believed to be the wife of Vidasus and her links to equivalents within the Roman pantheon are subject to the same historical debate. Some argue that she was associated with the Roman goddess of the hunt, Diana, where others suggest that she was simply a local Illyrian goddess, only worshipped in the areas around Topuska. Like Diana, many surviving images depict her accompanied by nymphs. However, the only other evidence connecting the two goddesses, apart from the proximity of their shrines, is that both had a male consort who appeared to fulfil a similar role. As the goddess of the hunt, there are a number of myths attached to Diana that teach the importance of respect for the divine. One such story tells that when Diana caught a young huntsman by the name of Actaeon watching her bathe she turned him in to a stag, after which he was promptly torn to pieces by his own hunting hounds."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Fishermans_huts_flavour"	"Over many years humans have developed a variety of fishing methods from the spear fishing of the Egyptians to the use of fish-cages in Greece. People developed methods that were appropriate to the waters they were fishing and the fish they hoped to catch. The Celtic tribes of Britain and Ireland developed a small river-going vessel known as a 'coracle'. This lightweight, oval boat had a framework of willow rods that were covered with animal skin. Its low weight meant it could be easily carried, allowing fishermen to carry their boats down to the river from their homes. The design of the coracle varied slightly depending on the river where it was to be used. Coracles for tidal rivers, like the Tywi in Wales, were round and deep, whereas those designed for use in rapidly flowing water had shallow, flat bottoms."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_celts_Grove_of_epona_flavour"	"Epona was the Celtic goddess of horses and fertility, and her name is thought to come from a Gaulish word meaning 'great horse'. She was often depicted as a woman riding a horse side-saddle and accompanied by a foal, which represents her role as fertility goddess. She was eventually adopted into the Roman pantheon and her cult spread quickly across Europe among Roman cavalry, who saw her as their protector. Epona's role eventually expanded to be goddess of all those who worked with horses, as described in 'The Golden Ass' by Apuleus. This text also hints that small shrines to Epona were erected in stables and barns to protect their equine occupants."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_aurelian_walls"	"In AD 271, the Juthungi marched deep into northern Italy, defeated the Roman army near Placentia, and without further ado headed for Rome. The 'Eternal City' had outgrown the old Servian city walls and they no longer offered protection; whole districts lay exposed to the eventualities of barbarian savagery. Panic surged through the streets, but Emperor Aurelian managed to save Rome by expelling the invaders. Afterwards, he ordered the construction of new city walls. They were finished four years later, during the reign of Aurelian’s successor, Probus, and were justly named 'Mura Aureliane' ('The Aurelian Walls'). This defensive complex was truly a feat of military architecture and remained in use until the late 19th century. Formidable as they were, the walls show the fractured state of the Empire. Indeed, in the golden days of Pax Romana, Rome had little need of walls, for all threats were kept at the distant frontier."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Shrine_of_melqart_flavour"	"The cult of Melqart spread across the Mediterranean from its Phoenician home city of Tyre, and shrines were eventually dedicated in cities as far away as Gades, or Cadiz, in Hispania. As Phoenician power waned, Melqart’s cult remained popular among the Carthaginians probably because of their reliance on trade. He was often invoked as a witness when a deal or bargain was struck. According to Livy, Hannibal was a devout follower and made a pilgrimage to Gades before beginning his invasion of Italy. His piety was apparently rewarded, and Melqart granted Hannibal visions of the destruction he would cause. The Greeks sometimes linked Melqart to their own semi-divine hero, Heracles."	"True"

One of the Wenijiz family of earth gods descended from giants, 'the Lord'  was worshipped both as a god of peace and a warrior. As a handsome, manly figure he was called upon to make marriages fertile. Fraujaz rode in a chariot pulled by a boar, owned the fastest ship ever built and had a magical sword. Unfortunately, he was also a doomed figure, and destined to be struck down in the final battle of the gods. He was closely aligned to Freyr in later Norse mythology and to his female counterpart, Freya."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Wine_trader_flavour"	"The Greeks began making wine over 8,000 years ago and eventually traded it all across the Mediterranean. Wine was a civilising thing, promoting good conversation and bringing medical benefits. Retsina, still popular today, was a particular favourite across the Greek world. The Phoenicians spread viniculture along their trade routes from Canaan to North Africa, and from Carthage into Spain. Their winemaking techniques influenced both Greeks and Romans and they used amphorae to store wine. Around 600BC Greeks took winemaking to Massilia in southern Gaul, and helped establish a wine region that still exists today. Carthage produced good wines, including a raisin wine that was loved by Romans. The ubiquitous use of wine, both domestically and ceremonially, along with the easy cultivation of grapes in hot climates contributed to the spread of the this lucrative trade throughout the world."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Sacred_grove_flavour"	"Trees were considered sacred by many cultures, and in ancient Greece groves were believed to be populated by nymphs and other minor deities. They were places of calm, shade, and divine protection. Only initiates were allowed near the trees, and animals were not allowed to graze there. The most sacred grove in Greece was at Dodona, and dedicated to the Mother Goddess, the powerful earth goddess at the centre of nearly all ancient religions. According to Herodotus the site at Dodona had been used for thousands of years to foretell the future and seek advice.

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Shrine_of_hephaistos_flavour"	"Hephaistos, the god of fire, was also the master of smithing, sculpture and stone masonry, and therefore a good patron for mortal craftsmen of all kinds. Both volcanoes and forges were his responsibility, and the god was usually depicted with the humble tools of a blacksmith to hand. He was also depicted as being remarkably ugly and lame, but he had an arranged marriage to Aphrodite arranged by his father, Zeus, even though she strayed from the path of marital fidelity with monotonous regularity. The gods could be somewhat whimsical, at times. He was considered to be the Greek counterpart, or original, to the Roman god Vulcan, and was honoured by all sensible craft workers."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_black_sea_greek_religious_5_ephesus"	"In the Greek pantheon, Artemis was the goddess of many things; hunting, wilderness, childbirth and virginity, as well as the protector of young girls. However, the Ephesian Artemis was a separate, individual aspect of the deity. In the Ephesian form, she appears to have been worshipped as a distinct figure by pre-Hellenic cultures, thus pre-dating the Olympian Artemis. The Ephesian Artemis is depicted in wood carvings with many breasts, or 'eggs', which imply her status as a goddess of fertility. Some, however, have instead suggested that the egg-shapes are grapes or even bull testes, which some idols of Artemis depict hanging around her neck. Interestingly, her legs are encased in a term - a binding pillar - which bears resemblance to representations of the ancient Egyptian gods."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_marble_chain"	"Granite, marble and limestone were quarried for construction and decorative art across the classical world. Known for its toughness and durability, granite was perfect for the Pharaohs' burial tombs. As a result the King’s chamber inside the Great Pyramid of Cheops, the one remaining wonder of the ancient world, is still virtually airtight after nearly five thousand years. The Egyptians’ technology for cutting and moving granite was highly advanced. The pyramids’ exteriors were constructed from limestone. However, the Greeks and Romans preferred to use marble for their ornamental structures. Granite was often used for columns, city walls and roads. Limestone, which is easier to carve, was used for the outside of the pyramids and for ornate sarcophagi. It is, however, susceptible to rain corrosion, so many buildings and statues made from limestone have not survived."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_italic_training_grounds_flavour"	"As the art of warfare developed among the Italic peoples, tactics became more organised and required disciplined training in order to carry them out. For the Samnites, being a soldier was an integral part of the their lifestyle. Youth first trained for military service by serving as gatekeepers. Holidays were often celebrated with war-games, a practice later adopted by Rome. Another Samnite ‘invention’, later adopted by the Romans, was the manipular system. After a series of defeats using the Greek phalanx, culminating in the defeat at Caudine Forks, the Romans adopted this more flexible system, which better prepared them for fighting on the local terrain."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Fishing_port_flavour"	"Fish were a staple of many ancient diets, and methods of fishing have changed relatively little over the centuries since then. Spearfishing, hook-and-line and nets date back to the Stone Age, and could support large communities. Cast nets were commonly used at coastal outcrops. Circular in shape, they were weighted with stones around the edge, and had a drawstring that allowed the full net to be closed and hauled in. A complete contrast, in terms of effort expended, was trapping: common types included woven baskets or nets for seafood, or fish weirs that made use of tidal and river currents."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Subterrain_aqueduct_flavour"	"Subterranean tunnels were used to channel water from springs or rivers to settlements so that enemies could not tamper with the supply. Often with entrances and sources well concealed aqueducts could not be blocked or poisoned, allowing Hellenic towns and cities to hold out for extended periods. Due to the way it was made, the Eupalinian Aqueduct is famous: built in the 6th century BC, it connected the city of Samos to a hidden spring. It was just over one kilometre in length, and was dug from both ends at the same time - the digging teams meeting underground thanks to a superb grasp of geometry."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_horse_chain"	"A source of food, a symbol of wealth, a beast of burden and a tool of war, the horse was one of the most versatile commodities in the ancient world. Equus ferus’ role was tied to its physical form – the small, early horse could only be used to pull primitive chariots. Larger, faster horses were later bred and used by skirmishers to chase down troops, but it was not until the development of more muscular breeds that shock troops such as the Macedonian Companions and cataphracts came into being. Their long lances and heavy armour made these new-style heavy cavalry units deadly against infantry, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare forever."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Villa_flavour"	"Land was a major commodity in the Roman world. The elite were quick to realise its value and began investing in farmland, hiring and exploiting slave labour to run their enterprises. New farms grew on the outskirts of Rome, with villas for landowners when they wished to visit. These 'villa rustica' and their surrounding farmlands were the origins of the large agricultural estates or 'latifundia' that came about when wealthy landowners took over peasant farms on a large scale. The idea of villa rustica also appealed to a Roman's idea of a simple, virtuous lifestyle."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Enaree_Tent_flavour"	"Among the Scythians, at least according to the Greek writer Herodotus, diviners were held in high regard. The 'enarees' or 'man-women' used strips of linden bark, woven together, to divine the answer to many questions of past, present and future, and of this world and the next. They would advise kings on the best course of action, and act as judges when a man’s word was called into question. Divination was not an easy job, and a terrible punishment awaited any diviners who gave false judgement in the case of solemn oaths sworn 'on the hearth of the king'. Such failed enarees would be bound, hand and foot, placed in an ox cart filled with brushwood, and the mobile pyre would be set alight. The oxen would run off in terror, and might die from burns as well, but the diviner was certainly cooked alive. The same punishment was reserved for 'false prophets' as well as poor judges among the diviners, a useful sanction for keeping them honest."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_glass_chain"	"Although it occurs naturally the first man-made glass was probably produced in Egypt around 3500BC. Along with pottery, it was easily available and cheaply made by melting silica sand. The technique of blowing glass was discovered in the 1st century BC and following the Roman conquest of Egypt in 27BC it became widespread. It is estimated that over 13 billion items of glassware were produced during the seven centuries that Rome held sway over Mediterranean. It was used for everything from oil lamps to storage jars, plates and perfume bottles, but was also used for decoration and ornaments."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_olive_chain"	"The first cultivation of the olive tree possibly occurred on Crete around 2500BC. In Greek legend, the goddess Athena bestowed the gift of the olive tree on the people who named their city, Athens, after her, rather than the god Poseidon who only offered a well of saltwater. As such, the olive tree became hugely important to Hellenic culture - its leaves were used to crown athletes and Greeks rubbed the oil in before exercise and competition. Olive oil was exported to Egypt and Rome, and eventually all over the Mediterranean. Following Roman conquest, the olive tree and its branches were given to colonies to mark their surrender and the end of conflict. Rome’s expansion meant the trees spread further across the ancient world becoming, like wine and gold, a symbol of civilisation itself."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Harbour_flavour"	"Any port needs a safe anchorage and a harbour where cargoes are manhandled onto ships. Greeks and Romans had different approaches: the Greeks adapted to the local environment, while Romans tended to bend nature to their wills. This is clear in their harbour designs. As the Roman Empire grew, harbours had to be built as disembarkation points, sometimes in areas where there was no natural inlet, bay or easy landing spot. In such cases Roman engineers set out to remake the coastline, and they created artificial harbours for their ships. Using wood, concrete and huge stone blocks, they built dams, piers, wharfs, sea walls and even artificial islands to protect harbours. Trajan’s extraordinary harbour at Centumcellae had a large basin dug into the shoreline of the River Tiber, all enclosed by huge walls. It was also connected by canal to Ostia further down the river."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_black_sea_greek_religious_5_demeter"	"Demeter is the Greek goddess of the harvest, of earthen fertility and of grain, which is where her title 'She of the Grain' originates. Demeter is the mother of Persephone, who in Greek mythology was famously abducted by Hades. The abduction so shook Demeter that the seasons stopped and living things began to die as she searched tirelessly for her child, ultimately prompting intervention by Zeus. Demeter was celebrated by the festival of Thesmophoria and the secret rite of Eleusinian Mysteries. Thesmophoria was for women only; they were implored to leave their houses and live for three days outside the city, purifying themselves through bathing. Little more is known about this festival, but it is known that only women married to Athenian citizens could attend, and sacrifices were placed into the earth to decay."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Delicatessen_flavour"	"For a Roman, bread was a staple at every meal with some fifty varieties being noted by writers of the period. Breakfast was usually bread dipped in wine or oil with cheese, milk, eggs and olives. Meat was scarce and hardly ever eaten by the poor, who relied more on fish complemented by radishes, pulses, turnips, leaks and porridge. Further up the social ladder, the richer citizens could enjoy a wide range of culinary delights. Spices from as far away as China found their way onto Roman tables and were used to flavour every kind of delicacy from peacocks' brains to stuffed dormice, flamingo tongues and parrot livers. Salads and fruits were widely consumed. Eating was at the heart of Roman social life, with dinner parties being a great way to show off to your friends. However, it became fashionable, not to say sensible, to employ a 'preagustator' or food taster for meals with hosts you were not quite sure about..."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_amber_chain"	"The regard in which amber was held is attested to by its associations with the sun god in his role as Elector or ‘the Awakener’. Later, the discovery of insects preserved in amber enabled Roman naturalists to correctly identify it as ancient, fossilised tree sap. However, this did little to dispel the commonly held belief that amber actually was solidified Lynx urine. It’s golden lustre meant amber was highly valued within the Greco-Roman world, where it was used to make jewellery, medicines and false hair. However, it meant much less to the barbarians who controlled the finest Balkan mines; they simply burnt amber as fuel for warmth."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Grove_of_Agin_flavour"	"Agin was a war god with roughly the same divine status and duties as the Greek god Ares. As might be expected, swords seem to have been part of a special area of responsibility. He was not the most important deity in the Scythian pantheon, but he was certainly the one that most interested Herodotus, the historian. As a Greek, Herodotus had a self-justifiable suspicion of, and air of disapproval towards, all things barbarous. He maintained that the Scythians sacrificed one in every hundred prisoners of war to Agin, by pouring wine over their heads and then cutting their throats. He also claimed that sacrificial prisoners had their right arms cut off, and that these were thrown into the air. The severed arms and corpses would then be left littering the ground around Agin’s shrine."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_nur_military_arena"	"It is generally believed that Nuragic tombs were constructed in a semi-circular shape to serve as an arena, so fighters could participate in funeral games in honour of the deceased. The athletes usually carried a weapon similar to the cestus glove, which wraps the forearm in a rigid sheet usually made of bronze or another malleable metal. On the other arm, they carried a rectangular, convex shield. Nuragic funerary games may also have served as a form of military training, as their warriors often sported the same armaments in battle."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Farm_flavour"	"Outside of cities in the ancient world most people made a frugal living through agriculture. Major crops included cereals such as wheat and barley, fruits such as apples, plums, peaches, cherries and always olives wherever they could be grown. Most farms were family-owned businesses but as the cities grew so did demands on the available fertile land. Despite rising prices, it became difficult for small farmers to survive. Wealthy Romans bought up vast areas creating huge estates, or latifundia, to increase production. Slave labour was brought in and water was fed through irrigation ditches supplied by small reservoirs. The writer Pliny eventually complained that large-scale industrial farming ruined Italy and her provinces."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Light_horse_studs_flavour"	"Light cavalry was common in the armies of eastern states and steppe peoples. For all kinds of light horsemen, from the Aphraktoi to Scythian or Saka archers, speed was armour. They relied on the swiftness and stamina of their mounts, from majestic Persian horses to smaller and livelier Armenian breeds, and even dromedaries or Bactrian camels. Usually assigned to patrol trade routes and empty borderlands, and as scouts and flanking cavalry in times of war, such units were prized. In battle, light cavalry were expected to harry the enemy with javelins or arrows, and withdraw quickly in the face of serious opposition. When their numbers were great enough, they could chase off opposing skirmishers, but would only closely engage other troops once they broke, driving them from the field and preventing them rallying."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Dockshed_flavour"	"Economic and military dominance relied not only land victories but also on control of the sea. An empire had to be able to outfit merchant vessels and warships, as well as keep contact with colonies and trading partners, if it was to thrive and grow. Warships, from patrolling biremes to colossal quinqueremes were vital in maintaining trade networks and for moving and resupplying overseas expeditionary armies. In Carthage, following the Phoenician tradition, the docksheds of the fleet were improved by the construction of a great 'cothon'. A protected harbour, the cothon was built to house and outfit 220 warships. It resembled a great wheel, with the slips facing inwards towards a central island housing the commander and administrative headquarters of the fleet; a fine example of elegant and functional design."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Port_flavour"	"Ports were vital to the ever-growing Roman Empire. Rome's port of Ostia has been preserved for centuries; it was created in the 4th century BC as a military outpost to protect the mouth of the River Tiber. Later, the Emperor Claudius ingeniously developed it into the main landing for ships supplying the insatiable appetite of Rome. At its height, Ostia's 100,000 tradesmen, merchants and mariners kept Romans fed as reliably as the aqueducts gave them water. Warehouses, or horrea, stood full of grain arriving from Egypt, wine from Spain or spices from the east. There were even exotic animals destined for the arena. All had to be disembarked from the deep-hulled merchant ships, then transferred onto smaller lighters to be taken up the shallow Tiber and into Rome."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Muster_field_flavour"	"Drawing upon their citizens or subjects, supplemented by mercenaries, Hellenic states could quickly muster troops in times of war. Their generals were usually elected officials or chosen from amongst the nobility. In Athens, the military consisted of the ephebes undergoing training and the older male citizens, led by the ten elected strategoi, or war ministers. Originally these men were hoplites but, following the pattern of Alexander the Great, they developed into the hypaspists, phalangites and thureophoroi over the following centuries. This shift also saw a move to more professional and mercenary troops being used. Wealthier citizens, those able to afford horses, provided the hippeis, or light cavalry, while noble cavalry again followed the Alexandrian model. Mercenaries, such as the Thracians, the Scythian bow-armed police of Athens, or the Galatian royal guard of Cleopatra, supplemented these mustered forces."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_dk_all_city_5_flavour"	"Known to us as Petra, this city was originally named Raqmu by the Nabataeans. Although famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, another name for Petra is the 'Rose City' due to the colour of the stone from which it was carved. The Nabataeans took advantage of Petra's proximity to regional trade routes to establish it as a major trading hub. In AD106, when Cornelius Palma was the Roman governor of Syria, the part of Arabia under Petra's control was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and the city became its capital. With the advent of Roman rule, the native dynasty came to an end, but the city continued to flourish. It was around this time that Petra's Roman road was built. A century later, during the time of Emperor Alexander Severus, when the city was at the height of its splendour, its economic issues seem to have been resolved. No more sumptuous tombs were constructed, owing apparently to a relatively-sudden catastrophe - invasion by the neo-Persian Sassanid Empire. Meanwhile, as Palmyra grew in importance and attracted trade away from Petra, the latter declined."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_dacian_bendis_flavour"	"The Thracian lunar goddess of the hunt, Bendis, is depicted as a huntress carrying a spear. She is very closely linked with the Greek goddess Artemis, and the two are almost uncannily similar in many regards. Unlike Artemis, however, Bendis is often depicted being followed by Satyrs and Maenads, which implies a more celebratory personification than her Greek counterpart. Bendis became popular in Greece after Thracian immigrants to Athens gained permission to construct a temple in the Attica district. This culminated in an official festival known as Bendideia, held annually on the 6th and 7th of the Greek month of Thargelion (around late May). Plato speaks of this ceremony in 'Republic', making mention of torch races on horseback through the night and a solemn procession of both Athenians and Thracians to the temple of Bendis. Steles from the era often show Bendis receiving gifts from worshippers, or offering gifts in turn to her twin brother, Apollo."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Library_flavour"	"The Romans liked to think of themselves as less 'bookish' than some of their more effete Mediterranean neighbours. However, their conquests of Greece, Macedonia, Asia Minor and other knowledgeable cultures did mean they were able to collect many texts to fill archives and private collections. This, along with their own scholarship, provided an invaluable source of research into history, culture, military tactics and technology. Books in a Roman library were mainly written in Latin or Greek and, as in modern libraries, covered all kinds of topics from politics and economics to agriculture and poetry. Books were extremely valuable due to their scarcity and because they were all hand-copied in the scriptoria of larger libraries. Statues of writers and decorative architecture often adorned the libraries making them memorial temples to wisdom and the written word."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_cult_Manichean"	"In the 3rd century AD, a Babylonian prophet called 'Mani' claimed to have experienced frequent visions of a divine nature that urged him to travel and seek the true meaning of life and the universe. Travel he did, right across Persia, reaching as far south as India. Having been introduced to every major religious doctrine at the time, Mani declared himself the final link in a long chain of prophets from Buddha to Jesus to Zoroaster. He spoke of an eternal struggle between light and darkness, and promoted spiritual purity while denouncing the material world. Mani preached this doctrine extensively and insisted that its scriptures be translated into other languages. This contributed to the longevity and vast dissemination of Manichaeism; Mani may have been executed at the order of the Sassanid Shahanshah Bahram around AD 277, but Manichaeism subsequently survived well into the Middle Ages."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Grove_of_Goitosyros_flavour"	"The Greek writer Herodotus, source for what little we know about Scythian religious practices, claimed that Goitosyros was roughly the same as the Greek god Apollo. Therefore it seems reasonable to assume that Goitosyros was a god of light, the sun, truth and many other manly accomplishments. It’s a reasonable assumption, but we have no way of telling what Goitosyros really personified, and in what ways. Like the other Scythian gods, we also have few details of specific rituals honouring, and requirements of, Goitosyros. It is, however, safe to assume that sacrifice played a part, and that sacrifices were expected to represent a true loss to the supplicant. In many cultures true offerings to the gods had to be something that it hurt to lose. If the offering didn't hurt then the disfavour of the gods could be sure to follow in short order."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_sassanid_religious_royal_unique"	"The grand statue of Shapur I was carved from a single huge stalagmite in a cave near the ancient city of Bishapur. Both the city and the statue were created to commemorate the astounding success the king had in his wars against the Romans. While the city is now a ruin, the statue remains mostly intact. The stone monument to the ancient ruler is almost seven metres high and humbles the viewer with both its size and the fine detail of its construction. For instance, each and every fold of the royal raiment - crown, hairstyle, and facial features - was chiselled with precision and care. It is believed that long after the Sassanids fell, the statue continued to stand, ominously, in the quiet darkness of the cave, possibly until the 14th century. It has been speculated that eventually an earthquake caused its legs to give out, however; the stone Shahanshah toppled and rested on its side until being set upright again during the 20th century."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Sacred_enclosure_flavour"	"The tribes of ancient Gaul, Britannia and Germania seldom constructed temple buildings to their gods, preferring instead to use natural boundaries such as riverbanks, springs, lakes, and tree groves to divide the everyday world from the spiritual realm. The oak was particularly sacred to the Celts, therefore oak groves were places of great importance where tribal matters were discussed and the druids sought answers from the gods. Believing anything that grew on a sacred oak was a sign or gift from the gods and should be treated with great respect, the druids considered mistletoe particularly powerful, thinking it a cure for any known poison."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Harbour_flavour"	"Harbours were vital in the ancient world, offering a safe refuge from pirates and storms and a place for trade. Although most ships hugged the coastlines, loading and unloading goods needed a sheltered harbour. A natural bay would do, but the construction of docks and wharfs, and sheltering sea walls made sea-going life much easier. Harbours were colossal undertakings, but the long-term benefits far outweighed the labour and costs involved."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_City_flavour"	"Even in the ancient world, cities grew up in places where people had already been living for a long time because the sites were defensible, controlled river crossings, had natural resources nearby or were safe from floods and other natural disasters. Cities, despite their rulers’ best intentions, were rarely planned. There might be sections where public buildings stood by broad, open streets and temples were laid out in magnificent splendour, and patrician dwellings hid rich opulence behind bland frontages. But equally likely, if you walked a few paces in the wrong direction, you would be guaranteed to find a maze of twisty backstreets, cheek-by-jowl houses, and run-down slums, alehouses, whorehouses and slaughterhouses, all jostling for what little space there was within the walls. The city was the world in miniature, with all the wonder and squalor that implied. Romans and Greeks equally could take civic pride in their urbanity and sophistication, and at the same moment be a little disgusted by the dirt and tawdriness of the back streets only yards away."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_leather_chain"	"People have been using hides to protect and clothe themselves ever since they began to trap and kill animals, according to archaeological evidence going back as far as the Palaeolithic period. As animal husbandry developed the use and availability of hides increased. Processes of tanning were introduced to make more durable leather. All manner of substances - tannins from trees to faeces and animal brains -  were used to treat the skins. Tanning was seen as a smelly, dirty even poisonous trade and so was banished to the outskirts of towns.

And so begins the Ephebic Oath sworn by all young male Athenians at their induction into the college that would forge them into citizens. Honour in battle was important to Hellenistic cultures and, as the gods watched, it was not whether you won but how you fought that marked you in the gods' sight. Excessive pride, or hubris, was a crime in many states, so boasting about good behaviour had its limits! The infantry was at the heart of any Greek-style army and fitness was part of basic military training. Having sworn their allegiance, soldiers had to be prepared to fight anywhere. Service in the army was an honour and great pride was taken in upholding Greek culture: "I shall not leave my city any less when I die but greater than when I was born!""	"True"

After suffering devastating losses at the hands of expert foreign archers, particularly the Parthians, they decided to enlist large numbers of 'sagittarii' as auxiliaries. In the east, they even borrowed the same design of composite bow, tipped with horn and bound with animal sinew, from their foreign rivals. Cretan, Syrian, Thracian and Balearic archers joined the infantry auxilia. 'Doctor Sagittariorum', or 'Master of the Bow', was the title given to the chief trainer of recruits. Later, mounted archers were recruited from eastern provinces where the locals specialised in this deadly form of warfare."	"True"

The Carthaginians were the most daring seafarers of the ancient world, preferring to hire mercenaries for their land wars whilst concentrating on the construction of a huge fleet of ever-larger ships. As Carthaginian trade and the need to transport troops increased, so did the importance of sea control. They built vast war galleys manned by citizen rowers. Alongside Greek-style triremes, quinqueremes ('fives') and septiremes ('sevens'), reinforced for ramming, were constructed. Even so, the largest ship of the ancient world was the Syracusia, designed by Archimedes and built in 240BC by King Hiero II. It used some sixty times the resources needed for an average trireme and took 300 skilled workmen over a year to build."	"True"

Eventually, in Nubia, he became associated with the birth of its rulers was even considered to be the father of the other gods in their pantheon. At some point, the Egyptians thought that Amun originated on a small mountain, Gebel Barkal, in Nubia. As time went on, they came to believe that Amun came to Nubian queens in human form to impregnate them with the kingdom's future divine rulers. These sons and daughters grew up to become the rulers of Nubia; as such, many were given some form of the god's name, most notably the Kushite king, Arakamani, and queen, Amanitore."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_religious_SolInvictus"	"The Romans worshipped the sun from their earliest days, long before the Republic, when Rome was still ruled by kings. The practise became more prominent from AD 218, when Emperor Elagabalus ascended to the throne. In his youth, he had served as a priest to the eastern cult of the solar deity Elagabal, worshipped in the city of Emesa. His reign was marked by a desire to promote his patron god within the Roman pantheon. Historians describe Elagabalus as cruel in his eccentricity and a true tyrant at times which urged his Praetorians Guard to take his life. Nevertheless, the cult of Sol Invictus, as the god Elagabal came to be known in Rome, was born. About fifty years later, Emperor Aurelian realized the unifying effect a common religion might have on the populace and adopted Sol Invictus as the chief Roman deity."	"True"

However, Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, in the book ‘Germania’, writes about the Germanic tribes with great respect. He described a people who were very open and hospitable, and who loved nothing more than feasting and celebrating great deeds. He was also impressed that they resolved all tribal issues at a council where every man's voice could be heard. Also remarking on the fidelity shown within Germanic marriages, there was one aspect of their lives that Tacitus found deplorable and barbaric - he thoroughly disapproved of "their habitual drunkenness”."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Sacred_Grove_flavour"	"The Romans had many words for woods but 'lucus' was reserved for a sacred grove, a circular garden of trees used for prayer, worship, contemplation and remembrance. Trees were planted as a memorial to the dead or dedicated to a particular local deity. The grove was an outdoor temple and a connection between humans, nature and divinity. They were also sometimes home to statues, shrines and even the tombs of loved ones. Augustus, for example, planted a grove to commemorate the loss of his two grandchildren. Found throughout the Empire, groves were an important part of the religious landscape where rituals could be carried out. A famous grove of oak trees was used by the Vestal Virgins of Rome until it was burned to the ground in the Great Fire of AD64."	"True"

For sound defensive reasons, Etruscan cities were frequently built on hills and featured relatively high walls. In terms of their street plans, there was a north-south axis with one or more east-west streets crossing it.

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_black_sea_trade_centre"	"Due to the generally poor quality of soil in Greece, cities were heavily reliant on external trade for the provision of many goods needed for daily life. Most often, items passed through the hands of kapeloi, or traders. Due to their role as 'middle men', individuals such as Aristotle accused kapeloi of a parasitic existence. In reality, their importance to a city ensured its success, if not respect. These individuals rented a space in the agora, which served both as a marketplace and as a centre of public life where trials and government took place. Meaning 'gathering place', the agora included market stalls, spaces for games, and platforms for public speaking."	"True"

Accounts written by Dio Cassius talk of a pre-battle ritual performed by the queen of the Iceni, Boudicca, during her war against the Roman occupation of Britannia. After encouraging her people to stand against the invaders, Boudicca released a hare from the folds of her dress. The crowd waited with bated breath to see the direction in which the animal ran, as it would predict the outcome of the battle. On this occasion the omens were good, and Boudicca thanked the goddess Andraste for watching over her people in their time of need.

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Hadast_flavour"	"A hadast or city was often established over centuries building on, or borrowing from, the remains of older cultures, and incorporating them into the new whole. They were often positioned to control, defend and exploit resources, fresh water, river crossings and natural ports, trade routes, or to take advantage of defensible hills or spurs of land. Rarely was an entirely new city founded: Carthage was the most famous and called 'Qart-hadast' which means only 'new city'. Supposedly founded by Phoenician colonists led by the Queen Dido, Carthage rose to power following Tyre’s collapse and the end of Phoenician power. Its position on the Mediterranean coast, and proximity to Sicily, gave it powerful command of maritime trade."	"True"

Typically, a caravanserai was a building with a square or rectangular walled exterior, with a single wide portal to permit large carriages to enter. The courtyard was almost always open to the sky and its inner walls were outfitted with stalls, bays, niches and chambers to accommodate the merchants, their animals and merchandise. As well as providing a safe place to rest, Caravanserais supported the flow of commerce, culture and information from Asia and Africa into southeastern Europe."	"True"

Originally an open market, it developed from a selling space to become the theatre for all important civic business: oration, gladiatorial contests, games, trials, executions and triumphal processions by returning armies. It was even used for elections. The original Forum in Rome was built on drained marshland in one of the oldest sections of the city. It grew into a hive of bustling trade with several huge buildings surrounding the public square. Government offices stood alongside cattle markets as the whole of Roman society rubbed shoulders as they traded, debated and socialised. Everywhere the Romans went they built new forums as essential meeting places and centres of commerce."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Brick_maker_flavour"	"There were two main techniques of brickmaking in the ancient world. The old fashioned way was to make sun-dried moulded mud or clay bricks of various sizes. This was developed in Asia Minor around 7500BC and then used across Greece and Egypt. However drying in the sun caused problems with the final product. It was best done in spring and autumn, as during summer bricks would dry too quickly on the outside, but not the inside, giving little strength. Sun drying also took time; some preferred their bricks to be at least five years old before they were put to use. The more advanced method of kiln baking was developed later. Baked bricks, or 'testa', found in Greek and Egyptian lands are usually dated after the Roman conquest. In fact, prior to being conquered the Greeks maintained the use of stone for city walls and major buildings; brick was mainly used for the houses of the poorer classes."	"True"

Amun was originally a deity in Thebes, who was eventually seen as being one with the ancient sun-god Ra, the two becoming Amun-Ra. To the Greek colonists in Egypt, Amun-Ra was an aspect of Zeus, or 'Zeus Ammon'. As such, he was worshipped across the Greek world, even as far away as Sparta and some Libyan colonies. Alexander the Great was seen as the liberator of Egypt, and was heralded as the 'son of Amun' by the oracle of the Siwa oasis, due to his victory over the Achaemenids at the Battle of Issus in 333BC. He publicly acknowledged his own divine status and called Zeus Ammon his father, a useful bit of propaganda for any world conqueror. The tradition of divine descent was well established for Pharaohs, and Alexander’s Ptolemaic successors kept the claim as an aid to their own legitimacy."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Herding_ground_flavour"	"Animal husbandry was important in the Hellenic world, as both manufacturing and trade increased. Animals such as goats and sheep were the most common livestock, but cattle were reared where resources and land would permit. Cattle were prized not simply for their meat, but as beasts of burden and for their hides. In contrast, horses were highly valued as mounts and their breeding was limited to the nobility and wealthy landowners that could afford to set aside land. Thessaly, with its ample plains, was well regarded for its horses; Thessalian cavalry had a proven reputation in Alexander the Great's army."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Shrine_of_eshmun_flavour"	"Principally worshipped as a healing deity, Eshmun was also a protector and the guardian of the Phoenician city of Sidon. He was also associated with spring and the renewal of life. Temples to Eshmun, such as the great complex near Sidon, had stone water channels and great basins to allow worshippers to carry out purifying ablutions before any rites. Votive offerings were left in the cisterns and pools as thanks for the gift of healing or in the hope of securing Eshmun’s favour. The story of Eshmun’s origin is a little gory, and gentlemen of a nervous disposition should look away now. Eshmun was originally a mortal man, and his beauty captivated and entranced the goddess Astarte. She pursued him relentlessly, determined to take him as a lover. In order to escape her advances, and in a rather permanent way, Eshmun castrated himself. With an axe. Unfortunately for all concerned, he died from the wound. The grief-stricken Astarte brought him back from the dead, and made him a god, so his axe work didn’t have the desired outcome after all."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pel_bronze_workshop"	"The discovery of bronze precedes classical antiquity by thousands of years. The first bronze alloy has been dated to 4500BC and its use spread rapidly throughout China and Iran before spreading west. The 'Bronze Age' was essentially a transitional period during which the world became a more civilised culture, with the implementation of tools through smelting, the creation of tin alloys, and the development of writing. Although the Bronze Age gave way to the Iron and Classical Ages, bronze remained widely used despite being more difficult to make and requiring more skill to work than iron and its alloys. However, the use of bronze eventually declined as it took a costly master craftsman to make good weaponry from it. Wrought iron was much cheaper and easier to use, despite generally only being 'strong enough' prior to the development of steel."	"True"

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pun_iberian_Ataegina_flavour"	"Second only to Endovelicus in the Iberian pantheon, Ataegina was the goddess of fertility, rebirth and nature, and so was associated most commonly with springtime. Revered as the goddess of resurrection and regeneration of all things, Ataegina caused the rebirth of the seasons and every year revived the fruits of the land. This association with the natural cycle is thought to be why idols of goats, and perhaps actual animal sacrifices, were offered up in Ataegina's name. She was mainly worshipped in the most southerly parts of the Iberian peninsula and chiefly by those tribes with Celtic connections. Also, the general lack of temple remains found dedicated to her suggests that shrines to the goddess were built in natural spaces away from settlements and have simply eroded away in the intervening time. Ataegina is often linked to her Greek counterpart, Persephone, who is associated with the cycle of spring as well as the underworld."	"True"

One way of preventing it from going off is by smoking it, whereby meat or fish is hung over smouldering wood chippings, usually of oak or alder. Smokehouses were also used to store the cured food for the winter months ahead. Aside from smoking, salting and pickling were common methods of preservation. As the salt draws the water from the food it also brings out the bacteria, slowing the oxidation process by which it goes rancid."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Manipular_Barracks_flavour"	"The greatness of Rome's army lay in training, tactics and the spirit of the people. Before the Second Samnite War in 315BC the Romans fought as a phalanx. As they suffered heavy defeats on difficult terrain a more manoeuvrable maniple system was adapted from the Samnites' tactics. Three divisions replaced the phalanx in battle: the young hastati in the front, the experienced principes as the main line and lastly the veteran triarii at the rear. This tactical system served Rome well until new enemies and new economic realities weakened it. Consul Gaius Marius made dramatic changes when he reformed the whole Roman army, creating what is now seen as the 'classic' Roman Legion as the basic battle force. His system proved extremely effective and was adopted by successive generations of leaders. It was the Marian Legions that went on to conquer the known world..."	"True"

With conflicts between the city-states on the rise, and threats from the outside world, the Greeks created the first hoplites around 700BC. These were free citizens, fighting as infantry who provided their own armour and weapons. There was no standard equipment and these soldiers carried shields and armour emblazoned with family symbols handed down over generations. However, the name 'hoplite' derived from the one piece of equipment they did have in common: the hoplon shield. This circular shield was held so as to protect not only the bearer but also the man to his left. As a single mass, hoplites moved in the famous phalanx formation, marching towards the enemy as one solid wall."	"True"

Later, the Roman general and consul Marcus Furius Camillus built a temple on the hill in gratitude for that warning. The first Roman mint was built adjacent to the temple and the coins it produced depicted the head of Juno Moneta. In early Republican times, bronze was yet to be overtaken by iron, and was still established as a common medium of exchange; most commodities were bought and sold by 'bronze and balance'. The bronze coins were stamped with Juno's face as, following the geese's warning, she was considered the protector of money and guardian of wealth."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_egypt_Shrine_of_isis_flavour"	"Isis was a mother and wife goddess: wife to Osiris, ruler of the dead, and mother of Horus, the god of the sky and war. Hers is a tragic story, with her husband brutally murdered and dismembered by his brother Set, but ultimately triumphant as she brings her beloved Osiris (mostly) back from the dead. As an agent of rebirth and mother, she was a goddess of both fertility and protection; many revered her as a patron. Under the Ptolemaic dynasty and later, under Roman occupation, the cult of Isis thrived. This partly stemmed from the belief that it was her tears for the fallen Osiris that caused the Nile to rise with such reliable regularity. Her greatest temples were located in the Nile delta and at the island complex of Philae, although the cult later spread through the Roman Mediterranean. It is also possible to perceive a distant echo of Isis and her son Horus in some stylised portrayals of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Shrine_of_zeus_flavour"	"After the Titan Kronos was overthrown by his children, Zeus, Hades and Poseidon, the three usurpers drew lots to divide up the spoils of the universe. Poseidon was given mastery of the seas; Hades received the underworld; Zeus gained control of the sky and the air. The earth, Gaia, was to be shared between them. In addition, Zeus was made King of the Gods on Mount Olympus. Much mortal effort was put into honouring Zeus, and he had more than 150 epithets to describe his powers and responsibilities. He was the Thunderer, for example, who controlled storms and lightning, so it was a foolish man indeed who got on the wrong side of Zeus, for he risked destruction. On the other hand, many were desperate to claim a connection to him. Despite his marriage to Hera Zeus fathered many children with other goddesses and mortals, the most famous being Herakles, known as Hercules by the Romans. During the classical period it was quite the fashion for Hellenic ruling houses to claim partial-divinity by descent from one of Zeus’ many bastards or, preferably, Herakles himself."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Recruiting_ground_flavour"	"In eastern Hellenistic states there was a limit to the number of Greek recruits available, and so local populations and mercenaries were used. After Alexander, leaders valued quantity over quality and some amassed huge armies of up to 70,000 men with only a small portion of Greek origin. Further west, Hellenistic states were caught up in conflicts that depleted their numbers, making mercenaries essential to continued warfare. In 227BC Cleomenes III of Sparta made 5000 free men citizens and allowed some slaves to buy their freedom so that he had more potential recruits. When Philip V of Macedon suffered huge losses he chose to reorganise his kingdom. During peacetime, he redistributed the population and was able to leave a large army to his son, Perseus."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_barb_religious_Fairguneis"	"Literally meaning 'thunder', 'Thunaraz' was a Germanic God of the Sky, with similarities to the Norse god Thor in that he governed storms. Best known for his incredible strength and for wielding a heavy hammer in battle as he rode his chariot across the heavens, Thunaraz was not inclined to get involved with the politics and lives of men as Teiwaz and Wodanaz did, but was seen as a great protector. He was the most popular god among the common German people and was commonly worshipped by farmers and rural folk, who depended on his gifts of rain for good harvests. As the Germanic tribes, although sometimes confederated together, were never organised into a standing army, their farmers were also their warriors during times of war. Thunaraz, in all his aggressive glory, was therefore a great inspiration to them. His power was seen in its purest form as lightning: a magical force that struck from the sky with great destructive power. Today, Thunaraz's name lives on in the English language as the fifth day of the week, 'Thursday' - literally 'Thor's Day'. His Gothic aspect was called 'Fairguneis', which might share common etymology with the later Slavic God of Storms, 'Perun'."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_etr_port"	"The Etruscans conducted trade not only with their fellow cities on the Apennine Peninsula, but also with contemporary Mediterranean civilisations such as the Greeks, Phoenicians and other eastern cultures. The Etruscans were noted for their iron exports, which they exchanged for ivory from Egypt, amber from the Baltic, and pottery from Greece and Ionia; fine Greek pottery in particular was very highly valued. The Etruscans’ strong maritime presence brought them a longstanding reputation for piracy, especially among Greeks. From the records of the time, there is little evidence to suggest that the Etruscans pirated more than any other people, but their control over a significant part of the Mediterranean is indisputable. Naturally, such actions brought Etruria into conflict with the major naval power of the age, Carthage, necessitating a treaty regarding exclusive areas of operation, signed around 509BC. This treaty made both powers stronger and led them to co-operate to defend their mutual interests against the Greek fleet. Later on, once Syracuse emerged as a dominant trading power, the Sicilian-based Greeks inflicted a major defeat on the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae, in 474BC. Around a century later, Dionysius I of Syracuse destroyed many of the Etruscan ports, leading to a decline in wealth for the previously extremely-rich Etruscan city-states."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_etr_administration"	"Most Etruscan city-states changed their governmental style from monarchies to oligarchical democracies around the 6th century BC. Despite this, the government essentially remained a theocracy, because the Etruscans were united by a common religion. Surviving Etruscan texts indicate that there were large numbers of magistrates led by a ‘zilach’, who was their chief. Each city-state was part of a confederation that met at the ‘Shrine of Voltumna’  once a year to discuss political and military matters.

At the foot of its upper part was one of the finest pieces of monumental architecture in the ancient world, the Great Altar of Pergamon. Commissioned by the Attalid king Eumenes II in the 2nd century BC, it is believed to have been dedicated to Zeus, and adorned with frieze bas-reliefs across its facade depicting the Gigantomachy; war between the Gods and Giants.

Smaller provinces were sometimes governed by a procurator, who also had a contingent of troops at his disposal. These men were generally auxiliaries recruited from among the local populace.

While initial versions were erected in wood for the purpose of just one performance, their increasing popularity led to official recognition in the form of monumentalised free standing structures. Surviving Roman plays are nearly all reworks of Greek tragedy and comedy with an increased focus on music and dance to appeal to the more spectacle orientated Roman audience. The social status of the theatre is hard to discern as, although writers and orators often condemned it as an immoral corrupter of the rabble, evidence suggests that performances were regularly attended and enjoyed by scholars and emperors alike."

Depictions of Gobannus found in Britain show a bearded man wearing a belted tunic and conical cap, standing over his anvil with a pair of tongs in one hand and a hammer in the other. Perhaps the most famous record of this smith god is also a testament to the skill of those who worshipped him; a zinc tablet found in Bern, Switzerland, was considered a forgery for many years before it was eventually discovered that the tablet was in fact not zinc but an alloy of the metals which were deposited on the sides of furnaces."

Where temples were not present, the Samnites would swear their oath in linen tents."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ita_touto"	"The Samnite system of ‘touto’ – similar to the Roman ‘civitas’ except in scale – dictated the nature of their political and administrative life. Each touto was a mini-republic within the whole, with its own council and assemblies. Each chief councillor held the title ‘Meddix Tuticus’ (literally ‘community manager’), with representatives were elected by the populace and open criticism of the individuals holding power was encouraged in the true spirit of democracy."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Slave_trader_flavour"	"Slaves were an everyday, accepted part of Hellenic society and were found everywhere. They did everything from backbreaking labour in fields and mines to managing treasury accounts. In the 5th century BC it is believed there was one slave for every free man in 'democratic' Athens. Even free people on a modest living had at least one slave for menial tasks. Slaves were the lifeblood of the Hellenic economy and the slave trade was seen as perfectly necessary and justified. Most slaves were taken in wartime, while others were born into slavery, especially in Egypt. However, neither appearance or skin colour was the mark of a slave. Anyone could be a slave, even a fellow Greek from a different city. Many slaves were simply bought from traders who had acquired them in other distant countries. Prices varied enormously, with young, healthy, and attractive slaves fetching up to twenty times more than older, weaker ones."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_egypt_Shrine_of_serapis_flavour"	"Serapis was an attempt to blend Egyptian and Greek culture under one joint deity, a deliberate act by Ptolemy I Soter in an attempt to legitimise his rule. Serapis, a god of abundance and resurrection, was Greek in appearance but with associated Egyptian symbology: the god had a 'modius' as his headdress - resembling a standard measuring basket of grain. It is possible that Serapis was a local god of Rhakotis, the settlement that became Alexandria, or the Babylonian Ea, as consulted by Alexander. Ptolemy III built the Serapeum of Alexandria, the greatest temple of Serapis in Egypt. The large complex even included part of the Library of Alexandria. The Serapeum was eventually destroyed during disturbances between Christians and pagans in AD391."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Fire_alter_flavour"	"In the east, fire as well as water was a symbol of purity, and banished dark and chaotic forces from the world. Zoroastrianism, which greatly influenced later monotheistic faiths, had temples that housed 'atar', or holy fire. Earlier, there had been a reverence for hearth fire as the source of warmth, light and food. Holy shrines and temples began as raised mounds on which fires were lit and offerings were made. In Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda, the force of wisdom and truth, was opposed by Angra Mainyu, the destructive spirit of chaos. Ahura Mazda's fire kept chaos at bay, and played a part in divination and oracular predictions. The priests would interpret the flames, or burn a variety of spices and other substances, inhaling the smoke to make contact with the world beyond."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Royal_sanctuary_flavour"	"Veneration of ancestors and the worship of royalty, living and dead, were commonplace throughout the ancient world. The details varied, with ancestors being worshipped almost as household gods, to temple complexes and great tombs being constructed in remembrance of powerful rulers. Interment of kings and rulers was common. In Persian traditions, bodies could be placed in stone monuments, such as the tomb of Cyrus the Great at Pasargadae. Rock monuments and tombs, which housed Achaemenid rulers such as Darius the Great, dominated their landscapes. The point of these great structures, however, was always the same: a clear and simple reminder to ordinary people that their rulers were powerful and had a history of being powerful. The dead were intended to be 'awe-full'."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Blacksmith_flavour"	"Smithing defines the arrival of the Bronze and Iron Ages, and blacksmiths could be found in almost every town and city, even in the developed world, until relatively recent times. Iron was beaten into shape for nails, knives, tools and, of course, weapons. A good blacksmith could turn his hand to anything, but as Rome's need for manufactured goods grew, there was a degree of specialisation in large-scale craft work. Lots of small-scale forges in the same place were able to turn out large amounts of reasonably standard iron goods. However, with slaves being so plentiful, the Romans never had the incentive to mechanise and use water-driven power tools, the first step towards an industrial revolution."	"True"

He is often depicted standing at Baal side's, ready to serve him; even his name translates as 'Calf of Baal', further confirming his role as aide to the head of Palmyrene's pantheon. Aglibol was also considered to be a relation of the Phoenician goddess Astarte, Goddess of Love and War, and as such wore soldiers garb along with a moon halo across his shoulder signifying his affiliation with the lunar domain."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ven_celts_horses"	"The Celts held horses in high regard; they were considered prestige possessions and revered for their strength and vitality. As a result, Celtic cavalry, like that of many armies, was the preserve of the wealthy nobility. Developments in saddle technology gave horsemen a firm seat without the need for stirrups; four pommels held the rider's thighs and this, in turn, allowed greater movement when using a sword or spear. With this improvement, cavalry tactics emerged and two-man chariots declined, as they were no longer the only fast-moving strike force available. Some cavalrymen carried long swords and, in the same fashion as traditional chariot riders, were given to dismounting and fighting on foot. As their reputation increased, Celtic horsemen became a much sought-after mercenary force and, over the centuries, served in the Carthaginian, Egyptian and Roman armies."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Blacksmith_flavour"	"Blacksmiths were held in high regard in the Celtic world, considered to be equal in status to the druids and other important members of society due to their ability to work magic with fire and metal. Each of the tribes of Europe had their own god of smiths, but all shared an association with fire and its power. Much like the Greek god Hephaestus, Gobannus, the Celtic patron of smiths, is depicted as a powerful, bearded man who carries a hammer. In Irish myth the smith god appears in a trinity as, Goibhniu, Luchta and Credhne. Goibhniu was the smith, Luchta the wright and Credhne the metalworker; when their talents combined they produced powerful weapons and beautiful artifacts, the likes of which no mortal had ever seen."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ita_military_buff"	"As the art of warfare developed among the Italic peoples, tactics became more organised and required disciplined training in order to carry them out. For the Samnites, being a soldier was an integral part of the their lifestyle. Youth first trained for military service by serving as gatekeepers. Holidays were often celebrated with war-games, a practice later adopted by Rome. Another Samnite ‘invention’, later adopted by the Romans, was the manipular system. After a series of defeats using the Greek phalanx, culminating in the defeat at Caudine Forks, the Romans adopted this more flexible system, which better prepared them for fighting on the local terrain."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_armenia_religious_christ_unique"	"Among other things, Armenia is known for being the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion. According to tradition, this happened after the Christian priest, Gregory the Illuminator, healed the mental malady of the Armenian king, Tiridates III, who had been a notorious persecutor of Christians up to that point. Having recovered his health his eyes were opened and he saw the error of his ways, urging his people to follow the teachings of the one who had cured him. Soon afterwards, in a vision, Gregory beheld Jesus Christ himself as he descended from heaven with a hammer made of gold, with which he pointed out the location of a temple that was to be built. Under Gregory's guidance, the first cathedral was constructed at Vagharshapat, the capital, probably between AD 301 and AD 303 and given the name 'Etchmiadzin' or 'The Descent of the Only Begotten Son of God'."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_admin_GarrisonChain"	"The 'vigiles urbani' were a body of seven thousand free people tasked by Emperor Augustus with fighting fires in Rome's labyrinthine streets. Although ostensibly a fire patrol, they were also able to thwart any criminal activity or public disorder they came across. Along with the vigiles, policing was responsibility of the 'cohortes urbanae' who were deployed as a means of riot control. Additionally, should the circumstances prove to be sufficiently dire, they were trained well enough to participate in field battles. Although they were never as important, and therefore never wielded the political power of the praetorians, service in the cohortes urbanae could be used as a stepping stone towards enlistment in that prestigious unit."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Muster_Field_flavour"	"Serving in the Roman Legions was originally part of the duties of a property-owning citizen. Slaves, freedmen and criminals were never given arms. The citizen Legions would be called up to serve for a campaign season. They were a militia who needed some training before battle. They were deployed as hoplites, fighting in Greek-style as a phalanx. Over time, the military system evolved with the introduction of the manipular system and then the later Marian Reforms. The end result was a professional force; by the 1st century BC citizens joined the Legions as a job for life. The need to keep the army and its commanders busy and away from Roman politics must have influenced Rome's permanent interest in conquest and expansionism!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Farm_flavour"	"The cultivation of land in the hot climate around the Mediterranean was not always easy. Irrigation and crop rotation were used in Greece, especially where the soil fertility was poor and farmland uncommon. Terracing allowed for small fields to be created on the steep hillsides of islands and valleys. Olives, figs and grapes were grown everywhere. Honey was very important as a delicacy because it was seen as a connection with the gods. Bread was the staple diet, with up to seventy different types known. It was made from wheat or barley. Barley was preferred because it was less demanding to grow and more productive than wheat. Animals were kept but meat was mainly consumed at festival times. Greeks also associated meat-eating with nomads and barbaric cultures, while civilised people tamed and then ate nature. Animals were also more useful alive: oxen were beasts of burden, and goats were kept for milk and cheese."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Port_flavour"	"For all those states bordering the Mediterranean it was vital to command the seas around their land. Any people wishing to expand looked to control trade routes and invade other countries by sea. It was far easier to sail 1,000 km than march a tenth of that distance. Good ports were the key and became the hub where shipbuilding yards were found cheek-by-jowl with markets, naval garrisons and countless sea-based traders. The port that served Athens, Piraeus, was described by Aristophanes as a hectic, bustling concoction of sailors clamouring for pay, rations being served out, men trafficking for corn, onions, leeks, and figs, all to the sound of the hammering of the dockyards and boatswains’ pipes and flutes. Carthage made its wealth and name through its two artificial harbours, and Alexandria in Egypt was also one of the largest ports of the ancient world."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Majore_field_flavour"	"Majore was a sport similar in concept to rugby but using a solid wooden ball. A popular game in Mesopotamia since the Bronze Age, it spread throughout the east over the following centuries. Games such as Majore, along with boxing and wrestling, were accessible to all people. This made them important to society, as they not only entertained people but also glorified their rulers and patron gods."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Tophet_flavour"	"This vast children's cemetery was a field of urns estimated to have been used for at least 20,000 interments. It was named by modern-day archaeologists in reference to the place where the Canaanites sacrificed their children in the Valley of Hinnom, as mentioned in the Old Testament. There is no way of telling whether the Carthaginians followed the same rites; some Greek and Roman writers vilify them for practicing child sacrifice, but this may be propaganda. It is difficult to tell from the existing remains whether or not the children and youths died from natural causes or were sacrificed. According to the accounts that talk of human sacrifice, children were hurled into sacred fires as offerings to Ba'al Hammon. Those sent to the flames included the children of the wealthy and powerful, for what was given up had to be valuable for the sacrifice to be valid."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Amphora_Maker_flavour"	"As with many other items, the Romans took the basic design of the amphora from the Greeks. Terracotta amphorae were vase-shaped containers usually lined with a resin to make them watertight and all had two handles attached to the neck. They were used to store and transport everything from wine and olive oil to cereals and salt, and made by the thousand. In fact, they were so plentiful that after their contents had been used they were usually smashed rather than kept or returned. Many different types of amphorae have been found, but the standard wine amphora held around forty litres. They were crucial to trade across the Empire and thousands have been found intact at the bottom of the Mediterranean due to shipwrecks and a watery end to their travels!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_barb_jeweller"	"Barbarian tribes were characterised in civilised minds by an unrestrained wildness, closeness to nature and emphasis on visual impact. What remains of their jewellery does not contradict this. The elaborate La Tene style featured flora and fauna imbued with a wild, snaking energy that gave the signature 'torc' its name (from the Latin ‘torqueo’, or twist). This item’s popularity was largely due to its potency as a status signifier in a society that was highly stratified and conscious of display. Enamelling techniques were enthusiastically received by the barbarians, so much so that they rapidly became world leaders, producing elaborate items of jewellery prized throughout the ancient world."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Combat_Posts_flavour"	"Combat training began with simple weapon exercises using wooden swords and spears against large posts driven into the ground. Recruits were also paired up, as in gladiator schools, and taught close-quarters fighting with weighted weapons. The legionary would take up a modern boxer’s stance and learn to thrust and jab forward while protecting himself with the shield. Once they had proved themselves with training weapons, legionaries were fully equipped and instructed in formation tactics. Drill halls, or basilica exertoria, were built so that training could continue during the winter months. Unlucky recruits, or those on punishment, would just have to train outside in all weathers!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_egypt_Shrine_of_imhotep_flavour"	"The cult of Imhotep began some two thousand years after his death, when he was deified as the patron of healing and medicine because of his legendary skill and wisdom. Originally from Memphis, the cult eventually merged with the worshippers of Thoth, the god of learning, medicine and architecture. In some places the two were treated as brothers. During his lifetime, Imhotep rose from humble origins to be High Priest of Ra and chancellor to Netjerikhet, or Djoser, the founder of the Third Dynasty. He lived during the 27th century BC, a time that was impossibly remote, even in the time of the Ptolemaic pharaohs. He was the foremost architect, engineer, philosopher and physician of his age and, not surprisingly, one of the first of each in recorded history."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Flock_of_Sheep_flavour"	"Sheep are extremely useful animals: able to scratch a living from poor land, hardy, tasty, and wool-bearing. Given that nomads must take everything with them as they move across the world, sheep are three agricultural crops, milk, meat and wool, in self-propelled packages. Their milk feeds the young. Their meat fills men’s bellies. Their wool puts clothes on backs, and blankets to sleep beneath. There is, from a wise nomad’s point of view, very little to dislike about sheep, other than their attractiveness to wolves and other, human predators. As the sheep travel with nomads so must everything else to do with survival. Nomad tools, from looms to forges, are fully the equal of anything created by 'civilised' men, except they can be packed away and moved easily."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_all_jeweller"	"Jewellers provided the ancient world with one of the most potent methods of displaying wealth and status. The art of smithing precious metals was re-introduced to the western Mediterranean from the east, which also acted as the source for most of the raw ingredients. The inevitable associations with far off places made jewellery all the more prestigious, as ownership signalled extensive trade connections. In time, the Greco-Roman world developed its own unique styles with ever increasing sophistication. The cameo, a method of carving a layered gem with a raised relief of contrasting colour, is arguably the finest example, and was highly sought after at the time."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Horse_pens"	"Horses played an important role in Celtic society, both spiritually and practically. Many Roman writers freely admitted that the Celts were excellent horsemen, and they went as far as calling Celtic mercenaries the best cavalry in the Roman army. The Romans even adopted a Celtic deity in the hope that she would bestow the equine knowledge and skill of the Celts upon Rome. Epona is one of very few deities to be accepted into the Roman pantheon without change, although her role did develop over time. Eventually, she provided protection for all those who worked with horses and not just the animals themselves. She was a popular deity among the Roman cavalry, and her cult spread across Europe wherever the Romans had cavalry garrisons."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_palmyra_religious_yarhibol"	"Near the city of Palmyra there was a spring called 'Efqa', one of many that turned the city into a green jewel amidst the sun-scorched Syrian desert. People believed that it was home to an otherwordly guardian in the god Yarhibol, who was possibly an ancient personification of the spring itself. As the city of Palmyra grew, its populace became ever more sophisticated in line with their veneration of Efqa. Yarhibol came to be associated with the sun, and played an important role in civil business, the Palmyrenes considering him a divine judge and a patron of just conduct and honourable behaviour."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Levy_camp_flavour"	"Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers. Parthian armies, for example, were created by command of the king, who ordered his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and hamspah - or levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ita_town"	"Samnite society was a natural evolution from their beginnings as peasant sheep farmers along the Apennine Peninsula. It was not organised under a single government, and initially even the concept of the city-state was foreign to them. Instead, urban gatherings known as ‘pagus’ were common; the roots of the word refer to a staked-out boundary, indicating that pagi were meeting spaces where the various tribal leaders could meet to conduct state and business affairs. Each pagus was semi-autonomous, being responsible for its own laws and practices, but had to muster troops for a central army should the Samnites be threatened from without."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_armenia_religious_christ"	"There were Christians in Armenia almost from the time of the new religion's inception. The bible states that, after Jesus sent out his apostles on a mission to spread the faith across the land, two of them - St Thaddeus and St Bartholomew - headed for Armenia. There, they preached among the local populace and brought many new believers to the budding religion. St Bartholomew is said to have died a martyr's death in Armenia, either by beheading or by being flayed alive. In spite of governmental attempts to suppress the spread of Christianity, the religion continued to grow; it's not surprising, then, that Armenia became the first Christian realm, at the beginning of the 4th century AD."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_barb_spring"	"Springs were areas of both practical and religious significance in the ancient world. In times when rivers were prone to contamination and subject to seasonal variations, springs provided a consistent source of pure water for a population. The necessity of water earned it a place in the mythology of many ancient religions, and the sight of this precious substance gushing out of the ground was enough evidence for many sites to be declared sacred. Legends sprang up to explain their origins and miraculous powers were often assigned to them, invoked by votive offerings of precious objects."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Brine_distiller_flavour"	"Salt was a valuable commodity that many barbarian tribes traded with the 'civilised' world. Archaeologists are able to identify areas of high salt production by the presence of a refuse deposit known as 'briquetage'. Ancient salt production started with pottery vessels; brine was added to these and allowed to dry out and form salt cakes. These pots were then smashed to release the salt cakes, resulting in large quantities of pottery shards. A recent discovery at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site, next to a salt spring in Lunca, Romania, suggest that the Neolithic inhabitants of the area were boiling the salt-laden spring water to extract the salt as far back as 6050BC, making it the oldest known salt works in the world."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Monument_of_leonidas_flavour"	"King Leonidas was the Spartan's Spartan. In 480BC, he led 300 hoplites, his personal guard, north to the pass of Thermopylae to fight a mighty Persian army under Xerxes. Leonidas could bring no more men, because a sacred festival would not allow more of the Spartans to go to war. Xerxes had, seemingly, brought everyone in the east against the Greeks. Although in his 60s, Leonidas personally led the defence of the narrow pass and held it for two days before his force was betrayed and cut down from the rear. The Persians killed everyone and mutilated the body of Leonidas. His defence, however, bought time and that time gave the Greeks their eventual victory. Leonidas' heroics were the epitome of being Spartan, and forty years later his remains were exhumed and the 'Leonidaeum', a monumental shrine, was built to inspire all those who looked upon it."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_admin_TaxChain"	"The expanding territory of the Roman Empire demanded a bureaucratic system of ever-growing complexity. The duties of collecting and managing taxes were handled by quaestors. Taxes aside, a quaestor also served as a direct subordinate of a provincial governor and sometimes had a military role too. The Imperial treasury itself was overseen by an official with the title 'rationalis', who was involved in tax collection, currency flow and the management of mines and mints. Careful deliberation was required before appointing a rationalis, as too much gold concentrated in a single pair of hands tends to muddle the mind of their owner..."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Enclosed_land_flavour"	"Enclosing land allowed farmers to keep a better watch on their herds and flocks. The construction of wooden fences and banks of earth also served to keep intruders and wild animals away from livestock. It is thought that some Celtic farmers valued their animals so highly they let them sleep inside their homes at night to make doubly sure that they would be safe from thieves and predators. More practically, this is also a good way of keeping everyone in a family warm. As Celtic society progressed and the population increased, large fortified settlements sprang up all over Europe. Many of these settlements had separate enclosures that were probably intended for livestock. During times of war the animals would have been driven between the inner and outer defences of a hill fort, protecting them from attackers while maintaining a fresh food source for the defenders."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_gaul_civilised_mine_flavour"	"Although it was greatly advanced by the Romans, many other cultures had long traditions of quarrying and mining. Over time, skilled freemen and artisan stonemasons appeared, who could extract and prepare the raw materials on-site. Gold and gem mining in Egypt, for example, began with the extraction of material from easily accessible alluvial deposits, while shaft mining in Nubia began as early as 1300BC. In the latter, ancient methods such as fire-setting were employed, using water to rapidly cool the heated stone and shatter the rock face. Quarrying stone, for great cities and monuments, was well advanced by the 3rd century BC. From the Parthenon to the Pyramids, the capacity of the ancients to extract, work, sculpt, and transport stone is still evident today."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_dk_saba_stables_camel_flavour"	"Many Middle Eastern warriors preferred camel cavalry to using horses in battle. In arid regions, the benefits were clear, as camels can store water in their humps and are generally hard to spook. They also have the 'advantage' of their peculiar smell which, up wind, was a guaranteed way of panicking any enemy horse units they came into contact with. The Romans first encountered camels during their decisive war against Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire. At the Battle of Magnesia in 190BC, Antiochus deployed Arab bowmen riding camels alongside his deadly scythed chariots. As you might expect, the Seleucid forces were out-fought and defeated by the supremely-drilled Legions, but the Romans nevertheless appreciated the value of these foul-smelling beasts and formed units of dromedarii - literally 'camel riders' - to patrol their eastern desert frontiers. They were also used by the Emperor Claudius during the invasion of Britannia in AD43; he brought elephants to terrify the Britons and camels to spook their chariot horses - something which worked exactly as planned."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Clay_pit_flavour"	"The tribes of ancient Europe kept very few written records, so much of what we know of their way of life comes from archaeological discoveries. For example, we know that the ancient Celts fired pots in kilns that allowed air, or rather oxygen, to be introduced, thus allowing the potter to control the colour of his work. It is clear from later finds that potters learnt that the introduction of liquid to the clay, before firing, could also affect its colour, and this led to new and more complicated patterns emerging. The differences in pattern design also reveals the differences between the tribes. Pottery discovered in Gaul and Britannia tends to favour elaborate scenes of hunting, sports or deities compared to the more basic patterns found in other areas of Europe."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Grain_market_flavour"	"Grain was the most important crop for human and animal consumption. Wheat, millet and barley were the staple crops. The Greeks struggled with grain production because of their poor soil and limited land area for agriculture, so trade in grain was essential. In Piraeus, Athens' port, grain would arrive by boat and be held in the Deigma on the famous colonnaded Makra Stoa. Merchants could inspect samples, or deigmata, of the imported crops on stalls made of reeds. It was a hot and dusty place teeming with bustling activity from dawn until dusk."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Acropolis_flavour"	"Acropolis means 'the top of the city', and is used to describe a collection of important buildings on a hill or elevated land within the city walls. This was a common feature of many ancient cities, though now the Athens acropolis is the most famous. In Athens the site was used as early as the 14th century BC for the Mycenaean royal palace. Later it was converted into a place of sacred significance, and by the 6th century BC, it was dotted with temples and monuments. These were destroyed by the Persian invasion in 480BC. Under Perikles, some thirty years later, the Acropolis regained its majesty when the Parthenon was constructed."	"True"

Most commonly depicted as an antlered man sitting cross legged, it has been argued that the antlers mark Cernunnos as an animal deity. His depiction on the famous Gundestrup Cauldron certainly supports this theory, as he is shown surrounded by animals. Others, however, see him simply as a god of nature or a fertility symbol. He often appears wearing a torc around his neck, around his antlers, or simply held in one hand. Torcs were a symbol of high status, which possibly explains their association with the immortal Cernunnos."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Woodworker_flavour"	"Although wood was the main building material for most of the tribes of Europe, each developed their own construction techniques depending on what was available. Some even developed techniques that allowed them to build in areas previously considered uninhabitable. The tribes of Ireland and Scotland built homes in rivers and lakes: manmade islands, or crannogs, provided their occupants with protection against attacks from men and beasts. The construction of the island involved wooden piles to create a sturdy base, in a circle to minimise erosion. They were often reached by wooden gangways and had traditional wooden roundhouses at their centre."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_rome_trader"	"The rise of the Roman Republic had a revolutionary impact on the nature of trade. The rapid acquisition of new territories ensured, for the first time, a reliable supply of goods from all over the known world. This allowed traders to move away from seasonal markets and into the world’s first permanent trading structures. Soon, forums were to be found in every settlement. Each one contained dozens of single-roomed shops known as tabernae, in addition to civic offices and temples. Due to the economic impact of the influx in trade, vendors were forced to display licences and conform to regulations. These were controlled by the aediles, minor officials whose role it was to manage all aspects of public spaces."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_dk_nab_alluzza_flavour"	"An important goddess for the Nabataeans, 'al-Uzza' means 'the mightiest one' in Arabic and was venerated at the ancient city of Petra. A sacred stone cube found near Mecca was used as part of her cult. As Hellenistic influences and traditions begun to make their way into Nabataean society, al-Uzza started to be associated with Aphrodite Ourania, the Greek goddess of love. 'Ourania', which translates as 'heavenly' or 'spiritual', was an epithet used to differentiate spiritual love of body and soul from its purely physical aspect."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_egypt_Shrine_of_hathor_and_maat_flavour"	"Hathor and Maat were widely worshipped under the Ptolemaic dynasty. Hathor was the goddess of birth, joy, love and motherhood and, for women, the promise of eternal life. She was often depicted with a cow’s head, but she was also a sky goddess and linked to the Milky Way of the night sky. Maat, on the other hand, dealt with the fate of the soul after death, as she weighed the hearts of the dead against the feather of truth in Duat, the Egyptian underworld. She was a personification of order: truth, law and justice were under her influence, and also the movement of the heavens and the seasons. The temple complex to Hathor and Maat on the West Bank at Thebes was extensively rebuilt by Ptolemy IV Philopator during his reign (221-205BC). Many depictions of the last pharaohs include emblems of Hathor and Maat to emphasise the justice and order they bring to the world."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Herding_ground_flavour"	"Agriculture and animal husbandry, alongside trade and manufacturing of goods and textiles, were vitally important to the Carthaginian economy. Herds of goats, sheep and oxen required large grazing areas and access to precious water. Mago, a Carthaginian writer, documented many of his people’s agricultural practices and, although his works no longer survive, they were taken back to Rome after the destruction of Carthage and translated into Greek and Latin. According to later commentators, his work deals with many farming practices including how to select bullocks and maintain the health of cattle, as well as how to collect bees from the carcass of a bull or ox."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ita_city"	"As barbarian society developed and their populations increased in size, the need for larger settlements became apparent. This gave rise to fortified settlements built on areas with natural defences, such as hilltops, cliffs and river banks. Stone and wooden defences were used, something which set these larger settlements apart. Some historians argue that this was not a defensive decision but was, in fact, a matter of prestige; a tribe could have more than one and their sizes varied significantly. Julius Caesar's study of the Gauls named their fortified settlements 'oppidum', noting that the differing sizes seemed to show the hierarchy within each tribe. The Romans used same word to refer to the mountain settlements of the Samnites."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Homestead_flavour"	"Most Greeks lived off the land, even in the 'city-states'. They lived and worked in largely self-sufficient homesteads growing barley, olives and figs, and herding sheep and goats. Life for a Greek farmer was harsh: good agricultural land was scarce, and rich landlords bought the best plots. The climate did not help much either: regular and rigorous ploughing was the only method of retaining the soil’s moisture following autumn's rains. This life bred hardy individuals, and freemen were often the best fighters in hoplite armies. Not only were they strong physical specimens, but they were well-motivated to defend their farmlands!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Shrine_of_kore_flavour"	"The cult of Kore began in 396BC in Carthage, as a measure to appease the goddess. One of her temples had been sacked by a Carthaginian army in Sicily, and shortly afterwards a devastating plague swept through the soldiers. The Carthaginians quickly realised that two and two did equal four, and began to honour the goddess themselves to turn aside her further wrath. Kore, or Persephone, was the daughter of Zeus and Demeter and was associated with the coming of spring and the renewal of growth. The Hellenic Persephone was supposed to spend six months of every year in the underworld as the consort of Hades. This brought about autumn and winter in the mortal world. Kore was similarly associated with Melqart, and so influenced the seasonal turning of the year. Her cult may also have adopted some of the rites of the Eleusinian mysteries but the exact details remain, as one would expect, suitably mysterious!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_east_weavery"	"Weaving is one of the oldest attested crafts in the world and, by antiquity, had permeated every level of society. In its most basic form, slaves and children manufactured cheap, functional cloth, but at the highest level it was practiced by noblewomen who produced rich tapestries and fabrics as a conspicuous display of wealth. The importance of weaving makes it one of the few crafts to hold a prominent place in the mythological world. Many cultures contain goddesses, like the Greek Fates, who spin and cut the threads of mortal existence, and this idea may have its roots in the tapestry weaver’s ability to make a scene come to life at the loom."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Shrine_of_ares_flavour"	"Ares was a bloody god, a god of rage, brutality, and lust for battle. All of these were vital qualities for a warrior, but they were also dangerous and Ares, for all his status as one of the twelve Olympians, was a god of chaos, to be placated and feared as well as worshipped. His own divine parents, Zeus and Hera, were not fond of him and his destructive ways. Despite all his rough and rowdy qualities, Ares was considered handsome, and Aphrodite, the goddess of love, fell for his charms. When she took a new lover, Adonis, as was inevitably going to be the case, Ares turned Adonis into a boar and slaughtered him in a jealous rage. Even his children, Phobos and Deimos - Fear and Terror - inherited his terrifying nature. For mortals, Ares is a bloody-handed god of fighting, where Athena is a goddess of strategic warfare. Both are necessary, and a wise man looked to both in times of danger. At the temple of Ares Enyalios Spartan youths sacrificed dogs in the hope of gaining his favour and courage."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Wild_Horses_flavour"	"According to Herodotus nomads such as the Scythians were “fed from horse-blood”; this is not entirely unbelievable, as many other nomad cultures have used their mounts as sources of food in times of desperation. As a civilised Greek he was, of course, properly quite horrified by these barbarous types and their ways. Yet horses and horsemanship were central to war and nomad society. Horses were valued above any other treasure; warlords were buried with horses, and all the accoutrements of cavalrymen. Despite 'civilised' disdain for barbarian warriors who smelled like a stable, nomads readily found employment as mercenaries in all the kingdoms that bordered the steppes. Their skills as horsemen, and the quality of horseflesh that they rode, made them the best, most brutal, raiding warriors of a brutal time."	"True"

It included 130 cells and trained twenty different types of fighter as they learned combat skills and endured rigorous exercises. Here men could specialise in fighting with horse and sword, war chariot, lasso, net and spear as well as the standard sword and shield combinations. As well as learning how to fight, the gladiators had to learn how to die. Spectators expected a brave and honourable death. A gladiator could never show any sign of fear, not even in his final moments. As many as 3,000 adoring fans could watch gladiatorial matches from the stands, in much the same way as people visit football grounds today. A short walk along a tunnel from the Ludus Magnus brought fighters to the Colosseum next door where death and glory awaited."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ita_agriculture"	"For the most part, the Samnite economy was based on agriculture. Unfortunately, it was their lack of interest in commerce that allowed the Romans to pull so far ahead of the Samnites in terms of wealth, and ultimately power. With everyone using the land for subsistence, and few big landowners making enormous, taxable profits, the Samnites just weren’t able to rise to the same heights. It was this, among other aspects of their culture, which made the Romans view their neighbours as rather backwards and uncivilised by comparison."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_etr_agriculture"	"In the Etruscan language, ‘pera’ translates literally as ‘house’ or ‘property’. The Etruscan pera was notable for its complex drainage systems, proving that the Etruscans had great knowledge of hydrology and hydraulics. It is believed that these very same skills were used to transform the marshland between the Capitol Hill and Velia in Rome into an area suitable for settling. The ‘Cloaca Maxima’ – ancient Rome’s remarkable sewage system that still functions today – stands as another testament to the engineering genius of the Etruscans."	"True"

He was one of the three Celtic deities that Lucan, the Roman writer, associated with human sacrifice. Lucan claimed that those sacrificed to Toutatis were drowned in a vat of liquid that might have been ale. Inscriptions to Toutatis have been found in Rome, Austria and Britain. Some historians even argue that a figure detailed on the Gundestrup Cauldron could be a representation of Toutatis; a man is shown dipping a figure into a cauldron or vat, echoing the sacrificial offerings made to the god. However, it has also been suggested that this image could just as easily represent the cauldron of regeneration, into which dead warriors would be thrown to be reborn as mutes."	"True"

They were oriented in such a way to enable the moon to be reflected during predefined periods. The most common type was circular, and accessed by steps going down into the water. These wells were probably dedicated to the cult of healthy waters, which also shows us how much the Nuragic tribes revered their water sources and understood the need to keep them pure."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_gaul_barbarian_mine_flavour"	"No less sophisticated at working metal than their ‘civilised’ counterparts, mines were commonplace amongst the Celtic and Germanic tribes, especially tin mines in Britannia and the many gold mines of the Iberian Peninsula. What differed was the efficiency of the mining, which was often conducted by the lower castes, or ‘free-men’, of these tribal populations. Fire-setting, both in open-pit and shaft mines, was probably the most common and ancient mining practice employed. This involved setting a fire against the rock face being worked before cooling it rapidly with water, thus causing a fracture. This dangerous practice was widespread in Europe as early as the Bronze Age, continuing throughout antiquity and well into the medieval period. Nevertheless, these tribes attained much power and wealth through their hazardous endeavours."	"True"

Archaeological finds indicate that viticultural practices were already in place there during the Late Bronze Age, long before the Punic Wars against Carthage, and even before the Romans set foot on the island. This indicates that the Nuragic people who lived on Sardinia were among the first to produce wine for trade, and maybe even to drink, in the ancient world."	"True"

She was represented holding fruit or a cornucopia, clear symbols of her aspect as a goddess of plenty. Images of Rosmerta have been found in France, Germany and Luxembourg, and many show her beside the Roman god Mercury or even wearing his winged helm suggesting that she was seen as his consort by the Romans. A relief found in Wasserbillig, Luxembourg also hints that Rosmerta may have had a healing aspect, as it carries an inscription relating to the opening of a hospital."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Cloaca_Maxima_flavour"	"The Cloaca Maxima was the large central sewer in Rome. Even today, parts of it are used to drain rainwater from the modern city. Originally an open canal built by the Etruscans in the 6th century BC, the Romans built over the waterway as the population grew. Water came into Rome via the aqueducts and then passed through the fountains, palaces, baths and latrines down into several tributary drains. These emptied into the Cloaca Maxima before all the waste of Rome went into the River Tiber and finally out to sea. Private houses had their own sewage systems in chamber pots and cess pits! This highly sophisticated drainage scheme had its own deity to watch over it: the goddess Cloacina ensured a clean city above."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Polo_pitch_flavour"	"Although its exact origins are now lost, Polo was one of the dominant sports of antiquity in the east. Popular in Arabic, Byzantine, Persian and Chinese cultures, it was seen as a means to practice and demonstrate horsemanship and many battle skills amongst those wealthy enough to own horses. A game only needed a flat field, but over time permanent pitches gradually appeared on which teams could train and play. Little is known about Polo’s early rules, scoring points by taking the ball from one end of the field to the other may have been the only one. This fits with the game's association with battle; riders may well have been allowed to strike or unhorse their opponents without penalty."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_cult_Mithraic"	"Mithraism was a mystery cult popular throughout the Roman Empire from the 1st century BC to the 4th century AD. It drew heavily on influences from eastern belief-systems, where 'Mithra' was the Zoroastrian deity of Covenant and Oath, among other divine responsibilities. Being a mystery cult, Mithraism's secrets were revealed only to the select few, which meant that very little information has survived and even that is fragmentary at best. It is known, however, that Mithraic rituals were conducted in underground temples known as 'mithraea' and that a shared festive meal was a part of the rites. 'Mithras' - the Roman interpretation of Mithra - was often depicted carousing with a solar deity, possibly the Roman god Sol Invictus, or ritually slaying a bull. To this day, no one has been able to ascertain exactly what this symbolism represents. Mithraism's 'system of seven degrees' was a hierarchy through which devotees ascended, each level bearing a symbolic name like 'raven' or 'sun runner' - again, we are still unsure what each level represented. Why is Mithras often depicted slaying a bull\? What exactly does the statuette of a naked man with the head of a lion depict\? Each question produces a multitude of further questions and the truth is lost to time forever."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Brickmaker_flavour"	"After the Romans came, saw and conquered they generally built. Having developed brick production in Italy, they tended to build in the style of their home towns. Romans used brickwork in every public and private building, putting fine stone cladding only on the outside. It was a huge step forward from using wood and thatch, wattle and daub or massive stonework. Construction was quick and relatively easy. Above all, the bricks used for walls and the tiles used for roofing were strong and durable. The Roman army was largely responsible for spreading the use of brickwork throughout the Empire with their kilns, often stamping the bricks with a Legion’s mark. The skill was passed on to local peoples and so became the standard building method in many lands for centuries."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Horse_Corral_flavour"	"Horses enjoyed a respected position in Roman society. Bred and kept for the great sport of racing, religious sacrifice and noble military service, they were less of the working animal they became in later cultures if only because of their cost. Horses were rarely used on farms other than when their sacrificial blood was given to purify other livestock or their heads were nailed to a farm wall in hope of a harvest blessing! It was claimed that Romulus himself had a personal guard of 300 horsemen. Roman cavalry was, at first, made up of the richer classes, the equestrians or 'riding class', who could pay for their own mounts. Later, the sense of being an elite was maintained as the upper classes were favoured, and they were paid three times as much as foot soldiers. As the Empire grew, Gallic, Numidian, Spanish and Thracian horsemen were added to the ranks. The cavalry was used to scout, carry messages and, in battle, to charge, flank an enemy quickly and gain advantage at critical moments."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Slave_Trader_flavour"	"At the height of the Roman Empire, slaves were a quarter of Italy’s six million population; in Rome every third person was a slave. The slave trade was essential to Roman society as human muscle power did everything from quarrying and mining to farming and building. Slavery was a huge business and criminals, POWs and those simply abducted from their homelands were sold for their labour. Once enslaved, the unlucky individual had no rights under Roman law. The biggest market was the Graecostadium in Rome, originally specialising in the trade of Greek prisoners. Domestic servants, field hands, quarrymen, gladiators and harlots were all traded flesh from as far afield as Britain, Parthia, Carthage and Egypt. In fact, such exotic origins meant a premium price!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Field_flavour"	"Not only did the Celts develop a field system that made it possible to clearly define the boundaries between farms, they also made machines that were far more advanced than those used by the Romans or the Greeks. The Celtic plough had a coulter, a sharp blade that turned the soil over on itself. This allowed farmers to work land that had previously been inaccessible to arable farming. A wide variety of crops were grown by the Celtic people, depending on the local climate and soil. For example, the Picts of Scotland were unable to grow olives and grape vines like the Gaulish tribes of the Po Valley; they relied instead on the raising of sheep for food and wool."	"True"

Myth has it that a single black dove perched on a great oak tree at Dodona and spoke. It declared that the will of Zeus would be heard from the oak, and that the site should be a place of worship. After such a miraculous beginning, prophecy was delivered through the rustling of leaves and the songs of the doves. The oracle would interpret these sounds, and record answers to questions on lead tablets. By the 4th century BC, walls enclosed the oak tree, and a stone temple was built. A century later, a fortified refuge was built, along with other temples. Although destroyed by the Aetolians in 219BC, the Dodona was rebuilt and then finally destroyed by the Romans in 168BC."

In the city of Palmyra, he was a part of the trinity that bound him to the Moon God, Aglibol, and Baal, Lord of the Gods, with the former two considered to be servants of the latter. Malakbel was Baal's messenger, which is what his name is believed to mean. Greeks equated him with Hermes, who likewise fulfilled the duties of divine courier. Additionally, he was thought to be a bringer of Spring, who displayed a fondness for plant life and domestic animals. A holy sanctuary within Palmyra, known as 'Sacred Wood' to reflect to honour the power of sun and moon over all mortal life, was dedicated to both Malakbel and Aglibol."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_military_CavalryForts"	"Roman military forts mainly consisted of barracks, with some supporting buildings around them. Each one was a long, narrow building where 'contubernia' (squads of eight soldiers) were accommodated in a pair of connected rooms. Thus, a single barracks could house 80 people or more - the size of a centuria. Similar quarters were also assigned to horsemen. In the abovementioned pair of connected rooms, cavalrymen resided in the rear chamber, along with their equipment, while their mounts lived at the front. In this way, cavalrymen could not only easily care for their trusty beasts but, in case of danger, could ready themselves and ride straight out to meet threats straight away."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Craftmans_quarter_flavour"	"Cities and towns would often have entire quarters devoted to specific trades, with workshops and markets clustered close together. The trades could be as varied as stoneworking and sculpture by masons, pottery, or the construction of artillery and siege equipment. While many siege artillery pieces would be made from local materials, specialised parts had to be made beforehand, and field artillery would always be made to march with the army. Equipment included various types of ballistae and onagers to sophisticated fire-raisers and the polybolos. Such city quarters became hubs of industry, needing all kinds of resources and support workshops to function. A ballista would require the efforts of blacksmiths, carpenters, butchers and even tanners. The last two may seem a little odd, but the weapon's power came from animal sinews. Masons or potters might also be employed to shape stone shot or make pots to carry chemical mixtures."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Cattle_Trader_flavour"	"Meat was an expensive commodity in the ancient world. Cattle trading was big business across the Roman Empire; the size of a herd was an old measure of wealth from before coinage became standardised. Most common people would only have eaten meat during religious festivals. After an animal was sacrificed, its meat was often divided up between the worshippers. Even so, demand could be high, and even the Circus Maximus was used as a holding area for beasts 'on the hoof' between religious festivals. The Forum Boarium was the biggest cattle and meat market in the city. It was still being used to graze cattle during the 19th century."	"True"

Her name can also mean ‘the One Who Writes’, linking her to language and writing. Indeed, the Germanic word ‘wreitan’ appears to be rooted in the same word.

The Palmyrenes had the advantage, as they were able to field the superior, heavy cataphracts - the fully-armoured knights of the age. These armoured horsemen scattered the Roman cavalrymen, and the outcome appeared grim. Just at that critical moment, an occurrence described as a "divine form" appeared on the battlefield and restored the morale of the fleeing Romans, rallied them in a counter attack, and enabled them to win the day.

These individuals rented a space in the Agora, which served both as a marketplace and as a centre of public life, where trials and government took place. Due to Kapeloi's role as 'middle men', individuals such as Aristotle accused them of a parasitic existence; the comic Aristophanes played on this prejudice by portraying his enemy Cleon as a ‘sausage seller’.

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_dacian_high_kings_hold_flavour"	"The notion of a 'high king', or a king above all other kings, is a monarchic title that originated in Celtic Ireland, and spread throughout the holds and kingdoms of barbarian feudal societies. High kings were superior to other local kings or warlords within their wider territory. In Ireland, the 'Ard-Ri' was known as ruler of the land, though whether or not his power was absolute is a matter of debate, as is how many of the Ard-Ri were real people or mythical. According to both traditions, the high kings of Ireland were seated in their hold at the Hill of Tara. The concept of a high king was prevalent in many other cultures as well. The ruler of the strongest Etruscan city states was referred to as the high king, as well as some Greek monarchs, such as the legendary Agamemnon.

This circus had a wide track for ten chariots to race at one time, making for exciting and dangerous races. In the hopes of even more drama the Greeks placed an altar to Taraxippus, the horse disturber, at each corner. This spirit supposedly frightened the horses at the most dangerous part of the track, causing crashes! Some hippodromes were also used for footraces.

While this loose relationship enabled provincial wealth and reduced rebellions, it came at the cost of secure control. As soon as a more powerful figure, such as Alexander, appeared there was little to stop territories transferring their taxes and allegiances.

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_illyrian_armatus_flavour"	"Armatus was the god of war and, like many ancient peoples, his followers believed the best way to earn the favour of their god was through blood and sacrifice. Due to the records of the Roman historian Arrian, we have a clear picture of the Illyrian revolt against Macedon of 335BC, and the king who devised it, Cleitus the Illyrian. Realising that Alexander the Great was distracted elsewhere, he managed to convince several neighbouring states to join him in an uprising against their Greek-speaking rulers. In order to gain the favour of the Armatus, Cleitus sacrificed three girls, three boys and three rams just before the Battle of Pelion. Sadly, these offerings were not enough and despite some hard fighting the Illyrians were caught off-guard at night. Alexander led a small mobile force into their camp, slaughtering the rebels where they slept."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_military_LegionaryForts"	"During its many conquests, the Roman army relied heavily on the ability to swiftly plan and construct camps for the shelter and protection of its soldiers while on the march. Since tribal barbarians never attempted to duplicate this degree of organisation, the Romans enjoyed the significant advantage of fielding armies that were better rested due to their fortified encampments. A camp's location was first carefully chosen, keeping important details such as defensibility and easy access to water in mind. Then, a special team of surveyors marked the layout, before finally the Legionaries erected the fortifications and pitched the tents. While some camps were temporary, abandoned by a Legion who was moving on, others were constantly garrisoned due to the strategic importance of their location. These were named 'castra stativa', meaning - unsurprisingly - 'permanent camp'; their fortifications were gradually augmented until they became imposing, formidable fortresses in their own right."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Kurgan_Field_flavour"	"Many peoples in the ancient world buried their dead kings and heroes in elaborate ceremonies, with all the trappings of a warrior to use in the afterlife. It was an accepted thing that a warrior would need horse, armour and sword in the world to come, just as he had in this one. Sometimes a man’s slaves would be killed and buried too, to serve him in the land of the dead. On the steppes, such burials were marked by large mounds, called 'kurgans' arranged along landscape features for many kilometres. The practice seems to have been very ancient indeed, and was used by many people across the steppes. These burial mounds have provided a rich archaeological treasure trove, and a glimpse into the world of the ancient steppes. Judging by the workmanship of many artifacts, these people were far from simple barbarians. Around a fifth of the burial mounds that have been excavated contain the remains of women buried with warrior grave goods, such as weapons and armour. There may well have been a kernel of truth in the Greek legends of the Amazons, a race of warrior women at the edge of the world."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Range_flavour"	"The use of any missile weapon requires practice and discipline, particularly if the enemy are firing or fighting back. Slings, javelins and bows were common weapons, and many troops were highly skilled in their use. The Parthian shot was a famed tactic of shooting while galloping away from the enemy, hopefully encouraging the more foolish among the targets to pursue, be cut off, and cut to shreds. Skirmishers were trained to harass, delay and annoy the enemy before the battle was joined, and to keep enemies from doing the same to their own side. In the east, the compound or recurve bow was in common use: unlike the self bow which is a single piece of wood, it was made from many different layers that each added to its strength. Sinew, horn and wood were glued together to make a strong, springy whole. The dry climate helped, because compound bows need to be kept free from damp, otherwise the animal glues used to build them start to decay."	"True"

Often carved from marble, fountains consisted of a great basin fed by bronze piping, usually with a stylised, mask-like waterspout. Animals, mythic beasts, and the gods were common designs. A fountain or pool was often the centrepiece of a courtyard or garden, and a display of power and wealth in eastern cities. Wells, springs and waterways channelled water to fill enclosed cisterns designed to reduce water loss through evaporation, which in turn fed the fountains by gravity."	"True"

Usually, it occupied a space in the agora, and housed the holy fire of Hestia, symbolising the life and survival of the city. The prytaneis, or democratic council met here on every day of its term, running society through numerous, rigorous meetings. The council members were fed by the state and never strayed far from the prytaneion during the day. Though they originated in Athens, prytaneis existed across the Hellenic world with varying amounts of power, some even gaining enough to become tyrannical, as happened at Miletus, the Bosporan Kingdom's home city."

During the 2nd century AD, Emperor Hadrian realised the benefits that a spy network would bring him and so contacted his provincial grain collectors, or frumentarii, who could use their connections and standing among the local population to obtain useful information. Their importance grew with time, in line of course with their arrogance. Overconfident, the frumentarii would often abuse their position for personal gain, causing resentment among the people. Emperor Diocletian subsequently disbanded the network, possibly during the 3rd century AD, replacing them with the 'agentes in rebus' - couriers who covertly monitored communication between imperial officials and could report any possible treachery."

Kept and slaughtered by the ancients for their meat, milk, hides and fur, horns, and even dung for fuel, they found a practical use for almost every part of the animal. Goat hide is hard and leathery, making it an ideal material for use as a receptacle for water or wine, plus as a material with which to make rudimentary parchment.

Like many other ancient peoples, the Berbers worshipped and sacrificed to the sun and moon, as described by Herodotus "They begin with the ear of the victim, which they cut off and throw over their house. This done, they kill the animal by twisting the neck. They sacrifice to the Sun and Moon, but not to any other god. This worship is common to all the Libyans.""	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Agora_flavour"	"Meaning 'gathering place', the agora was at the heart of Hellenic cities, acting as the artistic, political and spiritual centre of city life. As early as the 10th century BC, these open spaces were used as the assembly ground for hoplite armies, and for the citizens to hear the decisions of their courts and proclamations of their kings. The space eventually included market stalls, gatherings for games, and the public platforms for democracy and public speaking. In Athens, the agora was situated to the northwest of the Acropolis on the Panathenaic Way, and featured fountains and temples dedicated to Zeus, Apollo and Hephaestus, shrines and altars to other gods, and the Strategeion. This last building was dedicated to the cult of Strategos and was where the ten Strategoi, or Athenian generals, would discuss politics and military policy. 'Agoraphobia', the modern term for a fear of open spaces, has its roots in this concept of an open, public space."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Qanat_flavour"	"Qanats are a series of shafts connected by sloping tunnels that channel water underground over great distances. Dug deep into hills and mountains to take advantage of the higher water table, water is directed out into distribution canals. Being underground, little water is lost due to evaporation and so qanats provide a clean water supply relatively safe from natural disaster and sabotage. Following their development during the early 1st millennium BC, qanats spread rapidly across Africa and Asia. An overly-steep one would let the water flow too fast, draining the source and eroding the tunnel; if it were too shallow the water would not flow at all. Successful development of a qanat network required skilled artisans to locate potential water sources, plan routes, dig passageways to the right gradient and then keep them clear."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Shipwright_flavour"	"Shipbuilding, maintenance and having a safe harbour were obviously crucial to the trade and expansion of any Mediterranean people. From 500BC, the Greek trireme was the backbone of Hellenic navies. Up to forty metres long, and powered by a crew of 170 highly trained, professional rowers, the trireme was narrow and light, if a little unstable. Rowers were expected to throw javelins and sling stones while seated so as not to rock the boat! In Piraeus, the port of Athens, up to 750 triremes could be sheltered in nearly 500 neosokoi, or covered hangars, when not in use. The Carthaginians constructed an artificial harbour or 'cothon' to protect their ships from the sea. It is believed that other cothons could be drained to act as dry docks, allowing for ship maintenance."	"True"

The horse harnesses and vehicle fittings found just south of Gussage All Saints in southern England exemplify the casting method known as 'cire perdue', or the lost wax method. The item to be cast is first modelled out of beeswax. Once this model is completed it is then covered in clay, leaving at least two vents. The clay is then heated to melt the wax and bake the clay hard. The wax is poured out of the hardened mould, and then molten gold is poured through one of the vents to fill it. When the metal cools the mould can be broken to reveal the cast piece which can then be finished and polished by hand."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_east_satrap_city"	"Though the empires of the east had relied on client kings to indirectly administer their provinces for some time, satraps came into existence in their particular form under the Persian Achaemenid Empire. The divine associations attributed to kingship meant that the men appointed to rule their domains were instead called satraps, essentially governors who ruled in the Great King’s name. Despite this lesser status, they remained responsible for every aspect of administration from taxation to defence, and had miniature courts that reflected their power. Such autonomy decreased the administrative burden on the Great King but provided ample opportunity for rebellion when central power weakened."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_east_mint"	"According to some ancient commentators, the origin of the coin is the eastern kingdom of Lydia. As controlling the source of coinage bestowed economic benefits, the crude electrum coins were rapidly adopted and developed by the Greek cities and Achaemenid Empire alike. The ‘Darik’, struck by King Darius, showed the king running with a weapon and became the standard across the east until Alexander’s Macedonian invasion, following which more ornate Greek designs featuring portraits and deities appeared. This new, Greek coinage was seen as a potent symbol of power by eastern kings, who quickly minted their own versions."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_gaul_roman_mine_flavour"	"Mining in the Roman Republic, and later Empire, took many forms. Open-pit quarries provided the materials for monuments and statues, whereas shaft mines were used to extract copper, iron, lead, and tin, as well as gold and silver. As Roman territory grew, so did the need for materials, especially metal. This was not only to equip the legions, but also supply the demands of an increasingly Romanised world. Greater demand around the 1st century BC led to more efficient mining practices, such as 'hushing'. Vast reservoirs, controlled by sluice gates, would be used to create powerful waves to wash away soil from hillsides and reveal veins of ore. Shaft mining also became more sophisticated, with machines such as waterwheels and Archimedes’ screws being used, alongside slave labour, to lift water from purpose built sump chambers, thereby draining the mines."

Archaeological digs from right across Europe have found storage pits and souterrains – primitive underground larders – in abundance, enabling us to piece together the diets of the ancient tribes. A souterrain found at Carn Euny in Cornwall, England, even has a roof made from heavy stone slabs to protect it from the elements.

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_thracian_cabeiri_flavour"	"The Cabeiri was not one god, but a deistic pair of 'daimones', or lesser gods. Their history and mythology is varied and multiple, as their worship was for a very long time confined only to mystery cults on the islands of Samothrace and Lemnos, in the Aegean Sea. The Cabeiri are commonly linked to Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire and metallurgy, with some suggestion that he was their father, and that they assisted him at his Lemnian forge. Before the Cabeiri were connected to the Greek pantheon, however, they may have originally been purely Thracian deities who protected sailors. Seamen amongst the Greeks were also known to call for help from the Cabeiri in times of danger. The two were also considered proponents of hedonism, with patronage over the dances and orgies that the Samothracians made to their higher gods, such as Persephone. In the Greek tragedy by Aeschylus, the 'Cabiri' even play host to the Argonauts, entertaining them in typical fashion with a drunken orgy."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Slave_trader_flavour"	"In the ancient world, prisoners of war were often sold into slavery. Those captured by barbarians were just as unlucky as those taken by the 'civilised' races. Many of the Celtic words for slave have their roots in the Latin word 'captus', meaning captive, and this may be an indication that the custom of taking slaves was introduced to the tribes by either the Romans or the Greeks. These civilisations held very different views on slavery. In Greece a slave, be he born into servitude or captured as a prisoner of war, could never become a Greek citizen. The Romans on the other hand, gave their slaves complete freedom after manumission, becoming a 'libertus' - gaining political freedom and even the opportunity to run for public office."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Horse_pens_flavour"	"The scarcity of horses in some regions, climate, and the tradition of infantry fighting meant many Hellenistic rulers used a limited number of horsemen in their armies. Although the various states undoubtedly organised their forces differently, Greek military manuals point to both heavily armoured and lighter skirmishing cavalry. The 'hippeis' were the high ranking citizens who could afford to buy and keep horses, and they often served as a royal guard. Unlike their foot counterparts they continued to drill and practice in peacetime and took part in major processions and festivals. The cavalry of the Aeotolian League was regarded as the best cavalry of the Hellenistic world, while the Achaean League’s horsemen were thought of as largely ineffectual. Generals would supplement their own cavalry forces with the more experienced and better skilled mercenary riders, along with horsemen from conquered states."	"True"

It mentions that 'street keepers' - or 'koy ban' - were tasked with keeping law and order within the empire's towns and cities. The street keepers held limited authority over the regular populace, but the people were nevertheless supposed to follow their orders. The text also mentions 'gizir' - which means 'guards' - who were tasked with patrolling the streets. It is possible that these Sassanid proto-policemen were former infantrymen from the lowest classes of the Imperial army.

She was also connected to the pagan Anglo-Saxon goddess Eostre; much of Austro's symbolism, such as eggs and hares, are still used in European Easter celebrations today. Austro was said to have lights carried by rabbits before her; she brought the dawn as a new beginning, and spring renewal after the dark of winter.

There are a large variety of different Nuraghi, in various shapes and sizes, with earlier ones mainly consisting of a single tower. With time, the Nuragic builders learnt how to construct much more elaborate buildings with several towers linked by high ramparts protecting a central tower. The function of these Nuraghi is still very much debated among historians of the period; they could just as easily have been residences, strongholds, temples, houses - and most probably a combination of them all."

Although, according to an inscription the temple was dedicated to Baal in AD 32, it is highly likely that the building was further expanded and improved over the next few centuries. The interior of the temple was organised in the traditional eastern fashion, with spaces designated for altars to specific deities. The rest of the structure was influenced by Hellenistic and Roman architecture, as evidenced by its great colonnaded courtyard and crenelated roof. The temple boasted detailed bas-reliefs of celestial bodies and the signs of the zodiac. In Palmyra, Baal was associated with two other gods - the Sun God, Yarhibol, and the Moon God, Aglibol, the three forming a holy trinity that was worshipped as a whole at the Grand Temple."	"True"

Tin, in particular, was a much sought after resource as it was needed to make bronze. As great traders, the Carthaginians established the sea-trade, but it showed the locals where there were riches to be had.

The enlistment of auxiliary troops began by the first de facto Emperor, Augustus, drew on provincial non-citizens, allies and conquered nations.

From this we can assume that they may have shared attributes, including Neptune’s mastery of the seas. This would have made him an important part of the lives of the seafaring Illyrians. The Illyrians were such skilled pirates that the Romans, unable to prevent their near-constant raiding, were forced to send ambassadors to Queen Teuta. She was quick to point out that, under Illyrian law, what the Romans considered piracy was lawful trade, and furthermore that she had no right to interfere with the private enterprises of her people. Naturally, the Roman ambassadors didn’t take kindly to this response, informing Teuta that Rome had “an excellent custom of punishing private wrongs by public revenge".

Its tumulus-like structure is composed of two parts: a cylindrical base and a cone formed of steps. The platform of the mausoleum is surrounded by sixty columns which support the cornice on which the cone stands. Atop, a further, truncated cone made of bleachers gives the mausoleum the appearance of a dome. The pyramid also contains three false doors; the ancient Numidians believed in life after death and for this reason added these doorways to serve as portals through which the living could communicate with the dead, and also through which the souls of the deceased could move in and out of the burial chamber in the next world."

Its clerical hierarchy slowly took shape in tandem with its doctrine. By the end of the 3rd century AD, large cities such as Antioch, Alexandria and even Rome itself had become important Christian centres. Unfortunately, the adamant refusal of Christians to worship what they termed 'pagan gods' often drew the ire of the authorities, leading to outright persecution and oft-time, martyrdom.

Given the number of earthquakes in Greece and the surrounding islands, Poseidon was a god to respect and to placate as often as possible. He was, however, an unforgiving god as is shown by his hounding of Odysseus after the hero blinded Polyphemus, his Cyclops son, during his voyage home after the Trojan War.

This gave rise to fortified settlements, which tended to be built on areas with natural defences such as hilltops, cliffs or river banks. These were fortified with stone or wooden defences, setting them apart from the smaller settlements of the tribes. Some historians argue that the addition of fortifications was not a defensive decision but was, in fact, a matter of prestige. A tribe could have more than one of these fortified settlements and their sizes varied significantly. Julius Caesar made a study of the Gauls and named their fortified settlements 'oppidum', noting that the differing sizes seemed to show the hierarchy within each tribe."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_cult_Main"	"In ancient times, religion was a very practical aspect of everyone's lives. Praying to the gods and performing rituals and sacrifices was a means of securing their favour. Once the worshipper had done what was required of him, the god was supposed to act accordingly, indicating a relationship between mundane and divine that resembled a sort of spiritual contract. At the same time, another religion gradually spread across the world; the so-called 'mystery cults' were so called as their teachings were only revealed to a small group of carefully-selected disciples. Shrouded in secrecy, unfathomable symbolism and rituals, some mystery cults are hard for the modern observer to grasp. Others, such as Christianity, grew into enormous movements that have shaped history ever since."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_rome_city"	"As ancient cities grew the people turned to land beyond the walls: safety was traded for elbow-room. Undesirable businesses such as burial grounds, slaughterhouses and brickmaking were not particularly welcome within the city walls; animals and crops needed more space than the original boundaries allowed. The poor, of course, went to live alongside the more unsavoury businesses. 'Suburbia', then, was not quite the home of a burgeoning middle class, but a reaction to a lack of space. The growth of Rome meant that new perimeter walls had to be built. The Aurelian walls constructed in the 3rd century AD expanded the city well beyond the original 5th century BC Servian ones."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_greek_civil_town"	"The layout of an ancient Hellenistic settlement was a product of centuries of haphazard evolution. As the needs of the occupants changed over time they demolished, constructed and re-purposed their city without sparing a thought for its overall organisation. City layouts were often confusing and, in an effort to correct this, new settlements were constructed to a grid plan. This featured well-spaced, right angled streets which converged on the agora, the centre of civic life in the Greek world. The man credited with this idea, Hippodamus of Miletus, argued that its benefits were more than merely practical, its adoption ushering in a more ordered and balanced society for people to live in."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_egypt_Great_harbour"	"Egypt’s great costal harbours were a solution to the problem posed by the Nile to seafaring ships. Although the river is navigable, the delta silts-up and its waterways change course, sometimes annually. Although ships could navigate the deeper water courses, this constant change made siting ports near the delta impossible. The greatest of the harbours on the coast was undoubtedly at Alexandria. Following Alexander the Great’s orders, his architect Dinocrat had the silted-up port of Rhakotis cleared, and two great harbours constructed; one military, the other for merchant vessels by the island of Pharos to the mainland. This land bridge was one kilometre long and 200 metres wide. It also allowed the construction of the Pharos, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, between 280-247BC."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Artisans_lodgings_flavour"	"Many Roman writers attempted to reduce the Celts to a crude people who lived for war and little else. When describing the Celts of the Po Valley, Polybius commented that “their lives are very simple, and they had no knowledge whatsoever of art or science”. Due to archaeological finds we know this to be an oversimplification of a very complex society, and beautiful examples of Celtic art found all over Europe tell a very different story. Items like the Gundestrup Cauldron and the Desborough Mirror show that the Celts had excellent metalworking skills, an artistic eye and the ability to tell stories through their art. The intricate detail on the cauldron was preserved by the peat bog in which it was discovered. The glass used in the figures' eyes gives us some idea of the excellent artistic and craft abilities of the men who made the Cauldron."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_barb_warrior_lodge"	"Our image of the barbarian warrior owes much to the information passed down to us by their ‘civilised’ foes. The Greeks and Romans portrayed barbarians as warriors totally lacking in the virtues of self-control - a race of rage-fuelled alcoholics who rushed madly into battle without giving any thought to tactics. Historically, barbarian societies were indeed focused on individual martial prowess and display, but by the 1st century BC many had developed sophisticated squad-based combat with unique fighting styles, making barbarians valuable mercenaries in the eyes of the very people who had previously dismissed them."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Boat_yard_flavour"	"The Celtic Otherworld was a paradise to which the Celts believed they travelled to after death. Many myths and legends describe it as an island, and the idea that the dead passed beyond the horizon appears in many tales. The Byzantine philosopher Procopius of Caesarea recorded the beliefs of the tribes of Gaul and stated that they believed the Otherworld to be west of Britannia - modern-day Great Britain. According to Procopius, the Gauls believed that when a person died their soul would travel to the coast. Once there, they would bang on the doors of fishermen’s homes and beg passage across the sea. The fishermen would then ferry the souls to their destination and return home, never revealing the exact location of the Otherworld."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Range_flavour"	"Although Hellenistic armies used archers more than earlier Greek ones, they still relied on close-combat infantry. In early times archers had only been used to defend city walls or to cover hoplites in battle; they were never the main attack force. Bowmen were only about 10% of the Greek army in the Peloponnesian War. The Greeks learned from their battles with the Persians and, by the time of Alexander, some mounted archers had been introduced. They also often used skilled Cretan or Scythian mercenary bowmen who used the more powerful 'three-fingered grip' rather than just the thumb and forefinger to pull the string back. Other missile troops included peltasts: lightly-armed, skirmishing troops with a brace of javelins; and slingers who could hurl a stone beyond arrow range with pin-point accuracy."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pel_temple"	"The temples of the ancient world were human attempts to make manifest the majesty of the gods. Early Greek temples were more humble than their later, more famous iterations; creations of mud, brick and marble, with wooden construction throughout. In the 6th century BC, stone architecture overtook the Greek world and gave rise to the now-legendary 'Ionic' temples, many of which survive to this day. The Temple of Isthmia is considered one of the first examples of this style. Dedicated to Poseidon, it contains the archetypical sturdy Ionic colonnades, columns and arched roof. Many temples also housed gigantic statues of their patron gods; the statue of Zeus at Olympia reportedly towered at an awe-inspiring 42 feet high, reminding all who saw it of their insignificance before the gods."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ven_religious_reitia"	"Although ‘Reitia’ was among the most important goddesses of the Venetic pantheon (as borne out by the large number of artefacts found bearing her name and image), her exact position within it remains obscure. We do, however, know the names of some of her aspects; ‘Reitia Pora’, was ‘the Good and Kind’, with ‘Reitia Sahnate’ being ‘the Healer’. Her name can also mean ‘the One Who Writes’, linking her to language and writing. Indeed, the Germanic word ‘wreitan’ appears to be rooted in the same word. Eventually, when Rome conquered the whole of Italy, Reitia was considered to another aspect of Juno."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Consecrated_ground_flavour"	"The Greeks had hundreds of gods and spirits that governed nearly every aspect of life. For centuries the people had been paying them homage and consecrating spaces and buildings in their honour. The mythologies that told the stories of the gods, such as Homer’s The Iliad, were particularly important to the Hellenistic cultures and were treated as sacred texts. Numerous festivals would be held all year round so that the gods would bless the land and people. With so many gods, cults were established to focus beliefs on one particular deity or another. Like other peoples, belief in an afterlife was a given, so that mortal life did have consequences. For the Greeks, they might suffer in Tartarus, abide in Hades or go to the noble, beautiful fields of Elysium, depending on their path through life. Indeed, if strict funeral rites were not observed the dead might be condemned to wander as lost souls."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_palmyra_religious_nabu"	"Worshipped in ancient Babylon and Assyria, Nabu was the patron God of Scribes, Literacy, Natural Philosophy, and Wisdom. A clay tablet and stylus served as his symbol, for he was believed to have invented writing and served as a scribe to his father, Marduk. In time, Nabu rose in prominence among the Babylonians, eventually considered equal to Marduk. Known as 'Bel Ili' or 'Lord of the Gods', Nabu was an important Palmyrene deity due to his affiliation with all things scientific, and associated with Apollo in the 'intepretatio graeca' - the tendency among Greeks to identify elements of foreign culture with corresponding ones of their own."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Military_pier_flavour"	"For most civilisations, military dominance has always included mastery of the sea. It was always far easier to move men and material by sea than march them overland. Suppressing pirates and protecting trade was merely an extra benefit. Construction of good military vessels was therefore vital, with all kinds of ships from patrol biremes to colossal battle quinqueremes needed for a balanced force. Mastery of the sea prevented invasions too, and could even be a tool of diplomacy. By the Apamea treaty in 188BC, Rome limited the power of the Seleucid Empire by dictating the number of warships the Seleucids were allowed. When Antiochus V Eupator broke the treaty, the Romans sent delegations to Syrian cities, charged with sinking the excess warships."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_dk_saba_almaqah_flavour"	"Almaqah was both moon and sun-god in Sabaean culture. He is recognised widely as a protector, defending his people - the 'Children of Almaqah' - and depicted with a cluster of lightning bolts and a scythe-like weapon. Although generally considered a god of the moon, Almaqah is also the male counterpart to the Mesopotamian sun-god, Shamash (Shams), making him a sun deity also. His sacred animal was the bull, although he was also known as the 'Lord of the Ibex', as the wild mountain goats being another sacred animal in the Arabian polytheistic pantheon. It seems Almaqah's influence was not merely confined to Arabia. It was also felt much further afield; there is evidence of temples dedicated to the god as far west as Yeha and Addi Akawehm in the northern Ethiopian province of Tigray. According to steles found elsewhere in Tigray, Yeha's Temple of Almaqah was the central place of worship for the entire region."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_barb_trumpet_maker"	"Despite the musical limitations of the horn, few instruments held such importance in the ancient world. Because of their arresting tone, horns served a vital function in signalling in battles, hunts, assemblies or rituals, and use in these situations conferred a level of prestige upon the object itself. Although the earliest horns were simple conch shells or hollowed-out animal horns, the societal importance of the instrument led to a gradual increase in the ostentatiousness of their design. A prime example of this is the carnyx, a tall metal instrument with a head in the shape of bellowing animal. This was designed to be heard above the clash of battle and featured heavily in Roman representations of barbarians."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_all_mint"	"Silver mining was a difficult and dangerous business. The work was left to slaves who would often die after two or three years underground from lead poisoning. However, silver was so valuable it was thought to be worth the risk and even associated with divine powers because of its reflectivity and resistance to rust. It was also known for its health benefits. Although not exactly understanding its scientific properties, the Romans knew that dropping a coin into wine would make it safer to drink. Silver coins were minted as early as 600BC by the Greeks and the silver denarius of Rome is perhaps the most recognisable coin of the ancient world."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ita_major_city"	"As barbarian society developed and their populations increased in size, the need for larger settlements became apparent. This gave rise to fortified settlements built on areas with natural defences, such as hilltops, cliffs and river banks. Stone and wooden defences were used, something which set these larger settlements apart. Some historians argue that this was not a defensive decision but was, in fact, a matter of prestige; a tribe could have more than one and their sizes varied significantly. Julius Caesar's study of the Gauls named their fortified settlements 'oppidum', noting that the differing sizes seemed to show the hierarchy within each tribe. The Romans used same word to refer to the mountain settlements of the Samnites."	"True"

There is a body of evidence pointing to their worship of multiple deities, not least of all the implication by Herodotus that he was also known as Gebeleizis. The Getae believed in the immortality of the soul, thinking that when they died their soul simply travelled to meet Zalmoxis. It was even tradition, according to Herodotus, to pick a man by chance every four years and send him as messenger. This was achieved by hurling the chosen man into the air onto a trio of spears. If he survived the goring  he was unworthy of being the messenger and a bad person. If he was speared to death, however, the man’s soul would ascend to Zalmoxis as messenger to the god."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_east_military_buff_ranged"	"The frequency with which the eastern empires deployed the bow as a weapon set them apart from their counterparts in the western Mediterranean, who used their reliance on the ‘coward’s weapon’ as part of a wider caricature of effeminacy at a cultural level. In reality, the light composite bow was a devastating and versatile weapon that played a central role in some of the most effective tactics of the day. It was often used as a disruptive tool from behind a wall of shields to enhance cavalry charges, and even as a finisher – the Parthian shot enabled horse archers to lure enemy troops out of position by feigning retreat before opening fire on their exposed ranks."

As queen to Wodanaz she is his match in wisdom and majesty. The Germans made offerings to her to keep social order and bless their marriages and children. As she weaved the cosmic order, so she kept peace at home: mothers would pray to her to keep their sons safe in battle as they sewed protective garments for them.

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pel_shrine"	"Shrines generally take the form of small, sequestered spaces containing relics and images around an altar. In the Greek world, they were simple places for worship of the gods and heroes of the age. Often, the site chosen for a shrine was itself considered a place of worship and pilgrimage, but it was also common to find them in public spaces or inside the home. Those shrines dedicated to the gods tended to be more elaborate and grandiose than those intended for the veneration of heroes, which were smaller in scale and built around a simple pit in the ground for offerings."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Amphitheatron_flavour"	"The amphitheatron had a circular or oval plan, with a sloping gallery of seats looking over a central arena. Plays were a form of worship of the god Dionysus, and drama festivals such as the Dionysia in springtime were religious celebrations as well as entertaining. Officially, performances in the amphitheatron were only for men, but records show that some women did attend. Theatre changed during the Hellenistic period and, instead of the earlier grand tragedies, audiences wanted plays that were about their own lives rather than the gods and myth. This new style was a comedy of manners, and the extant fragments of Menander's plays show that they were far more sophisticated than the farcical works of Aristophanes and others. This 'New Comedy' went on to influence the playwrights of Rome."	"True"

It was said to be made from the fleece of a golden-haired, winged ram. Obtaining it would place Jason on the throne of Iolcus. The quest was fraught with danger, culminating in an epic final confrontation between Jason and its defenders, including fire-breathing bulls and an eternal dragon whose teeth became soldiers. Though dramatic and epic, the story of the Golden Fleece represents simple concepts; kingship, prosperity and wealth. To Colchians, it symbolised their ability to overcome and flourish without help from their Greek homeland."	"True"

One of her great works was the irrigation system, that came to be known as 'Zenobia's Canal' or 'El Kanat'. Its goal was to divert fresh water from the River Orontes directly into the city. Unfortunately, Aurelian put an end to the Palmyrene Empire, so the project was most likely abandoned long before its completion, yet traces of its construction can still be found within the city's bounds today."

The ancient Celts saw water as a purifier and worshiped it for its healing powers. A large temple complex, built by the Romans, alongside the River Severn in England, was dedicated to Nodens and featured dormitories, suggesting that it may have been a place of pilgrimage for the sick and infirm. The site of this temple may also have been chosen as it offered an excellent view over the river and would have been ideal for viewing the Severn Bore, a large wave which sweeps up river against the current. This natural spectacle can occur throughout the year but the largest bores tend to rise in the spring. The largest bore ever recorded reached a height of 2.8 metres."	"True"

Entertainment here was on a massive scale. Situated in a natural valley, the Circus has became synonymous with chariot racing but was used for all kinds of elaborate 'ludi', or games, often to celebrate religious festivals. Rather like the modern Olympics, the games were paid for by rich sponsors and tried to outdo previous events in terms of grandeur and pageantry. As well as chariot races, boxing, wrestling, gladiator contests, athletics, plays, recitals and even elephant fighting featured as events. The Circus Maximus itself was rebuilt several times, to make it grander and safer for spectators, and then more dangerous and exciting again: Julius Caesar ordered a moat to protect the crowd, but Nero then had it filled in so that everyone could be closer to the action!"

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Meeting_hall_flavour"	"Much of what we know of barbarian tribes comes from accounts set down by Roman and Greek writers, and they are often extremely critical. However, Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, in the book ‘Germania’, writes about the Germanic tribes with great respect. He described a people who were very open and hospitable, and who loved nothing more than feasting and celebrating great deeds. He was also impressed that they resolved all tribal issues at a council where every man's voice could be heard. Also remarking on the fidelity shown within Germanic marriages, there was one aspect of their lives that Tacitus found deplorable and barbaric - he thoroughly disapproved of “their habitual drunkenness”."

Since the Bronze Age fires had been used to smelt metal, and the skill of the smith forged swords and spear heads. With the arrival of iron blacksmiths sprang up in every town and city of Greece. Ploughs, axes, tools of every kind, and even jewellery were created. Yet even though smiths were skilled and necessary, theirs was a lowly trade, and never attained the status of armourers and masons. Hephaestus, the crippled son of Zeus, was the patron god of smithing. Like the trade itself, he was considered ugly and unglamorous."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Adobe_maker_flavour"	"Adobe has been used as a versatile and durable building material for thousands of years. It is formed from clay, sand and water, with some fibrous, organic binding matter such as straw or manure. It can be made on site as a continuous structure or turned into bricks by using wooden frames. The substance has several useful properties, and slowly absorbs and releases heat; adobe buildings stay cool in the day, and warm at night in arid, desert conditions. Traditionally, adobe was allowed to dry naturally in the sun, but bricks and tiles could also be fired in kilns. Because of its ingredients, adobe makers could easily construct temporary works next to large building sites. In large cities, where space was at a premium, some would almost always be given over to adobe production."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_etr_religion"	"The early Etruscan ‘tmia’ (or ‘sanctuary’) were usually open-air enclosures marked off from the rest of a settlement. This changed around 600BC when the Etruscans, through Greek influence, started building monumental temples. In a sacred context, and in contrast with Greek temples, Etruscan ones showed a clear differentiation between front and back, with a columnated deep front porch and an inner chamber or ‘cella’, which was flush with the podium on which the temple stood. When building their cemeteries and necropolises, the Etruscans went to great lengths to make their dead comfortable; their tombs were constructed in a similar way to houses designed for the living, and featured many equivalent details. Later-period tombs found in the city of Caere, for example, have windows, doors, columns and ceiling beams, and also came complete with furniture."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_navalbuff"	"Seaborne fleets were instrumental in Rome's naval dominance which led to the Mediterranean being lovingly dubbed "Mare Nostrum" or "Our Sea" in the early days of the Empire. Roman ships saw little to no action during the 2nd century AD and whenever a fleet had to intervene it was almost always used to support  ground troops. The Crisis of the 3rd Century abruptly changed the situation. As the Empire cracked apart from internal instability, the Saxoni launched coastal raids against Britannia, while the Gothi sailed across the Black Sea to torch the lands to the south. Rome's naval command had grown complacent with the long peace and so the marauding barbarians inflicted terrible casualties and destroyed much of its fleet. The writing was on the wall: the recruitment of properly-trained crews must be paramount if there was to be any hope of withstanding future invasions."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Hamlet_flavour"	"Wherever the Romans went they not only conquered but also settled and built communities. They used stone and brick to construct colonies that were meant to last. Colonial towns developed from small hamlets and villages, some of which already existed, becoming centres of regional administration and commerce. The planned provincial towns or 'civitates' were built in a square grid pattern with stone peripheral walls for protection. The smaller 'vici' were less formal, often growing up outside Roman army camps in order to supply soldiers with the comforts and pleasures of home."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Infantry_tents_flavour"	"Mustering a force required careful planning. Levies were often expected to provide their own arms, such as spear and shield, or javelins and even bows. If this was not done, they would have to be outfitted at the expense of the state treasury. This took time, and the easiest way to get everyone organised and equipped was in temporary camps. Dependent on circumstances and population, permanent quarters or barracks for levies would be built. Barrack-based troops could be used to supplement town watches or to patrol borders and guard trade routes. Even so, conscript levies were usually poorly trained, and more lightly equipped than noble, professional or mercenary soldiers."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Field_engineers_workshop_flavour"	"As empires expanded so technologies developed to enable attacks on defensive positions and lay siege to large cities. Field engineers became adept in the arts of using whatever resources were to hand to construct catapults, siege towers and battering rams to break down the enemy’s defences. The scorpion, a crossbow-like spear-thrower, the fire-raiser, a burning cauldron attached to a long beam on wheels, and the sambuca, a type of covered troop ladder, were early innovations in siege engineering. Philip V of Macedon used catapults along with field works in his defence of the Aous Valley in 198BC, where the Romans lost many men. Towering, literally, above all these were the huge siege towers needed to assault high walls. The Helepolis used against Rhodes in 304BC stood some forty metres high and apparently required 3,000 men to operate it!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_egypt_Great_library_flavour"	"The most famous of all ancient libraries was founded in 288BC as part of the Alexandrian Museum by Demetrius of Phaleron. Originally based on the library of Athens, it housed mainly Greek scrolls but was open to poets, scientists, scholars and philosophers from all peoples. It was the vision of Alexander, as Aristotle’s pupil, to bring together all the knowledge in the known world under one roof, and some 70,000 scrolls were held. Much medical, scientific and scholarly work was undertaken, including the first star atlas. Aristarchus, a scholar using the library, worked out that the world revolved around the sun nearly 2,000 years before Copernicus, and it was here that the Old Testament was first translated into Greek. For six centuries the Great Library embodied academic research and study. It declined after the Roman occupation and was destroyed by fire in AD272."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Odeon_flavour"	"An odeon was a small, intimate theatre that was ideal for musical concerts and smaller works. While plays were performed, the acoustics favoured musical concerts, as shown by the name which means 'singing place'. Poets competed for prizes and many performances of epic classics such as the Iliad and Odyssey were given to sophisticated audiences. The oldest known odeon was built in Skias in Sparta around 600BC. One of the largest and most impressive remaining examples is the one built in AD161 by Herodes of Atticus, a rich Athenian magnate. Its beamed roof was made of cedar and it was decorated with works of art. It stands by the Acropolis and seated up to 5,000 for musical concerts."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pun_iberian_Neto_flavour"	"As a god of war, Neto was known as 'lord of the ray' for his ability to harness the blistering heat and energy of the sun. Solar deities such as Neto were revered for this power, as the Sun was considered to be the mightiest of all things. As such, his symbol of worship was a bull, denoting the raw strength possessed of it. Neto is referenced on the Botorrita plaques of Zaragoza, and is thought to be linked to the Celtic war god Neit, who was worshipped in Ireland at around the same time. As the Iberian equivalent of the Greek god Apollo, linked to the Sun, and the Roman god of war, Mars (another name for Neto was 'Mars Neto'), it is implied that Neto represented order, security and knowledge, rather than the more chaotic violence of his direct equivalent, the Greek war god, Ares."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_egypt_Shrine_of_horus_flavour"	"Horus was commonly depicted as a falcon-headed man, or just as a falcon, but he had many aspects and responsibilities. During the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty and under the Romans he was worshipped as the son of Osiris and Isis, and as the god of the sky. He was also a god of war and a divine vengeance taker, due to his war against Set to avenge Osiris’ death. In another aspect, Horus the Elder was worshipped as the patron of pharaohs, a giver of great wisdom. Many temples, such as the Temple of Horus the Elder at Kom Ombo were rebuilt by the Ptolemaic pharaohs. Ptolemy VI Philometor is the earliest ruler named in any inscriptions at the complex; construction probably began under him, but certainly finished after his reign. Ptolemy VI Philometor was, of course, Greek, but was wise enough to follow local traditions."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_black_sea_greek_city_centre_library_5_pergamon"	"The Library of Pergamon was one of the largest in the ancient world. Second only to the great Library at Alexandria, the Attalid dynasty constructed it in direct emulation of its Alexandrian equivalent. It contained some 200,000 volumes of text, documented on early parchment known as 'pergaminus', as opposed to the Egyptian papyrus used at Alexandria. This caused the Alexandrians (who controlled the flow of Papyrus) no small amount of envy. The Library was designed with a gap between the outer walls and the bookshelves to aid air circulation, intended to prevent the region's natural humidity affecting the parchment. Legend says that Mark Antony, at the behest of Cleopatra, cleared the library of its entire catalogue and gifted it to his lover, ruining the collection and shrouding its true scope in mystery."

Nothing could be further from the truth. A number of structures have been discovered that show that so-called 'barbarians' had a firm grasp of building techniques and were able to construct homes and defences that have survived for thousands of years. Brochs, dry stone buildings found in Scotland, survived the harsh weather and provide interesting information about the people who built them. Many were multi-storey dwellings and historians still debate their use: some believe they were defensive structures; others argue they may have been prestige buildings, symbols of wealth and power."

By celebrating heaven the Ptolemies could claim divine sanction for their continued rule, and give public respect to the beliefs of common Egyptians. With many Greek colonists entering Egypt, the new temples also helped bring the two peoples together as one nation. Temples to Isis and Horus were deliberately placed next to those to Hellenised gods such as Zeus Ammon and Serapis, and connections between both pantheons were clearly made for worshippers. Alexandria featured the greatest of these new complexes but other sites, such as the Philae or Thebes, were also rebuilt to suit the political and religious needs of the Ptolemies."	"True"

It is possible that Phoenician travellers brought knowledge of the god to the city of Palmyra, where locals embraced it and elevated Baalshamin to the position of chief god in their pantheon. He, Aglibol, God of the Moon, and Malakbel, God of the Sun, were worshipped as a trinity that held deep spiritual weight among the faithful.

Therefore, it was important to always be on his good side if one hoped to see some rain in this arid part of the world."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_illyrian_vidasus_flavour"	"There is debate amongst historians as to the cultural significance of the Illyrian god, Vidasus. Some argue that he was a local deity who watched over the areas around Topuska and its people. This argument is based on the fact that nearly all of the reliefs depicting Vidasus and his divine consort Thana have been discovered in and around that area. However, the proximity of these findings to temples honouring the Roman god Silvanus and his wife Diana indicate that the Romans considered the two pairs to be aspects of the same divine being. Silvanus watched over the woods, fields and flocks, ensuring the fertility of the soil and its inhabitants, making him much beloved of those who worked the land. Both Silvanus and Vidasus had a large number of altars dedicated to them in the Topuska region, so clearly they were considered to be of great importance by the local people."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Wine_Trader_flavour"	"Romans loved wine and drank it every day. The wine trade grew alongside the Empire and became a huge business. Merchants took wine from Italy, Spain, Greece, Gaul and elsewhere to all parts of the Empire using amphorae stacked in ships. Sea transport was key as it could cost less to import wine from Spain by sea than to move it by road from home-grown vineyards. At the height of the trade up to 40,000 amphorae of wine were exported annually from Italy to Gaul and it is estimated that 500,000 litres were drunk every day in Rome alone! The Forum Vinarium was, effectively, the biggest wine shop of the ancient world. Wine was made using slave labour in both the Italian countryside and conquered lands. It has to be noted that the Romans were, for much of the Empire's lifespan, favoured with a warm climate that allowed viniculture in many northern lands."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Reservoir_flavour"	"Water was sacred to the ancient Celts. Rivers, wells and springs were all thought to have both medical and magical properties, and were often the sites of great sanctuaries. Perhaps the most famous of these can be found in the English spa town of Bath. The ancient Celts worshipped at its hot springs and attributed them to the goddess Sulis. After the Romans invaded, they  developed the springs further, turning them into baths and building a new temple to Sulis, who they equated with their own goddess Minerva. Over 130 lead curse tablets have been discovered within the springs, and it appears that theft was a common problem even then: many of the tablets curse the unknown thieves who took property whilst its owners bathed."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_east_herd"	"Herding is one of the original forms of basic agriculture that was disseminated around the Mediterranean in the Neolithic age. Populations that practiced herding obtained everything from food to furniture from the animals they owned, so were not tied to the land and could move freely in search of new grazing. This enabled a population to sustain itself in arid conditions unsuitable to cultivation, as well as making it resilient to climatic changes that might be devastating to a settled culture. The same mobility made herding populations famously difficult to control, especially as the habitual raids on the livestock of others led to the development of fearsome combat skills."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_dk_nab_dhushara_flavour"	"Dhu Shara' literally meaning 'Lord of the Mountain', was the chief deity in the Nabataean pantheon. He was represented by a rectangular block of black stone upon which the blood of the unfortunate sacrificial victims was spilled. The stone altar was mounted atop a golden pedestal and the whole sanctuary glowed with gold and votive offerings. The black stone of Dhu Shara was taken to the Ka'aba and became the focus of a cult there, which persisted for many centuries, even after the rise of Islam in the region during the 7th century AD. As Hellenistic culture begun to influence the Nabataeans, they started to adopt Greek traditions, finding parity between the Greek pantheon and their own. As such, Dhu Shara gained human form, and was equated with both Zeus and Dionysus as the leader of the Nubian gods."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ita_religious_mamers"	"As you might expect, war was central to Samnite society and the support of its governing deity was therefore paramount if the Samnites’ military endeavours were to be successful. The most important god within the Samnite pantheon was therefore ‘Mamers’, identified with the Roman Mars, god of war. Naturally, Mamers was greatly revered and worshipped, and like the Romans the Samnites practised the rite of ‘ver sacrum’ or ‘holy spring’ and superstitiously interpreted omens from the flight of birds or by inspecting the bowels of sacrificed animals. One tenth of all animals born in spring were sacrificed to Mamers. Fortunately, this didn’t include children, who were instead sent away once they reached military age and allegedly led by a sacred ox to their new homeland."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_rome_farming_town"	"Outside of the cities of the ancient world most people made a frugal living through agriculture. Major crops included cereals such as wheat and barley, fruits such as apples, plums, peaches, cherries and always olives wherever they could be grown. Most farms were family-owned businesses but as the cities grew so did demands on the available fertile land. Despite rising prices, it became difficult for small farmers to survive. Wealthy Romans bought up vast areas creating huge estates, or latifundia, to increase production. Slave labour was brought in and water was fed through irrigation ditches supplied by small reservoirs. The writer Pliny eventually complained that large-scale industrial farming ruined Italy and her provinces."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Practice_camp_flavour"	"Training areas were a common feature in Greek settlements where every citizen was expected to play a part in warfare. These camps, forts and 'stratopedon' prepared citizens, professional soldiers and mercenaries for the realities of the battlefield. It taught them how to follow orders, form up, and move as a phalanx, and to defend themselves and each other as a cohesive unit. Details of training varied across the Hellenic world; Spartan warriors, by virtue of being a dedicated army supported by their helot slaves, could devote their entire lives to military training. In contrast, Athens required its citizens to spend two years learning the military arts, with 18 year-old conscripts having instruction in weapons and being drilled in tactics and siegecraft for attack and defence."

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pun_greek_Theatre_Syracuse_flavour"	"The Greek theatre at Syracuse became renowned as the largest theatre in the known world, and the city itself became a cultural capital along with it. Built by order of the tyrant Hiero I, it is notable as the birthplace of comedy, courtesy of the playwright Epicharmos. Despite this, the theatre didn't become a well-known marvel until around 220BC, when Hiero II ordered it expanded to hold a potential 20,000 people, making it a cultural icon across the world. When Syracuse fell under Roman control, early Emperors modified the theatre again, removing some seats so that Roman gladiatorial games could be held."	"True"

War was at the heart of Roman imperialism and its governing deity Mars was crucial to the state’s expansionist ideals. He was rightly greatly revered and worshipped. A whole month, March, was put aside for his festivals, marking the beginning of the Roman year. Father of Romulus and Remus, Mars was associated with the very birth of Rome and thus Romans saw themselves as his children. Octavian built a temple to Mars, rather than Jupiter, on the Capitol in Rome to celebrate the overthrowing of Julius Caesar’s murderers. The Roman army believed Mars marched before them, so homage had to be paid to ensure success in battle."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Grove_of_Agrimpasa_flavour"	"Most information about the Scythian pantheon is secondhand, and filtered through Herodotus, the Greek writer. In the case of Agrimpasa, he equated the goddess to Aphrodite Urania, an aspect of Aphrodite who was more concerned with spiritual love rather than bodily lust. In comparing goddesses he was following an intellectual, if mostly snobbish, tradition of many civilised men. This idea of 'interpretatio graeca', or 'explaining the world in Greek terms' was fine for Herodotus and his intended audience. Anything alien could be explained by Greek examples and analogues. It is difficult to know what is accurate and reasonable in his description, as opposed to material that might be Herodotus fitting into his civilised Greek world view around awkward barbarian facts. At this remove, it’s almost impossible to judge."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_rom_city_centre_GreatCollonade"	"The main street of Palmyra was a massive architectural undertaking built over the course of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. A magnificent forest of columns and arches, it ran from the city's western gate to the temple of Bel in the south-eastern quarter. Funds for the construction of later known as the 'Great Colonnade of Palmyra' came from wealthy individuals and trading guilds, who in fact bought the right to place a statue of themselves along with an inscription on a column of their choosing. Emperor Septimius Severus contributed to the project by building a special arch there to commemorate his triumph over the Parthians. The Great Colonnade became the axis around which the Palmyra's everyday life spun; shops and markets were spread around the columns along with theatres, baths, monuments and temples, where believers flocked for rituals and prayer."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pun_iberian_Endovelicus_flavour"	"Endovelicus was an Iberian deity of health and healing, revered as an oracle and chief of their pantheon. The mainly Lusitanian tribes who worshipped him received his advice and protection, their people kept safe from harm. He was said to be a god of many faces who had visited the underworld in order to gain the power of healing; people believing that, by sleeping in the god's place of worship, he would speak to them as they slept and give them advice and knowledge of the future. Altars dating to the time of the Iberians' struggle against Rome indicate Endovelicus' central position in the resistance effort. Following the Roman subjugation of the region his cult spread to the rest of the Republic, who adopted the god into their own pantheon. His following was never stronger, however, than amongst the indigenous Lusitanian and Gallaecian peoples."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_east_town_centre"	"Spices were highly valued commodities, both for local consumption and trade with other peoples. Trade along what would become the Silk and Spice Roads began almost at the start of civilisation with the rise of farming and trade amongst Neolithic communities. It was not until Arab and Phoenician traders began trading spices and other luxury goods, such as gold, precious stones, silks and fine textiles, that fixed routes and markets began to appear. As well as spices to flavour foods, other items were traded, including those considered essential for religious rites, such as frankincense - tree resin which gives off a strong aroma when burned.

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_egypt_Peripatetic_school_flavour"	"Around 335BC Aristotle founded his school of philosophy. The name derived from the words for 'colonnade', and 'to wander'. Students would gather outside the Lyceum and Aristotle would lecture as they followed him on his walk. Many of the greatest minds in Greece came to hear him, and the school’s philosophy had a great impact on Hellenic culture. Aristotle, himself a student of Plato, was reputed to wander, in spirit at least, along the colonnade after his death. The school fell into decline in the 3rd century BC, but revived after the Roman occupation."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_egypt_Royal_sanctuary_flavour"	"Veneration of ancestors and the worship of divine royalty were common in the ancient world. Ancestors were commonly worshipped even in the meanest houses, while temples and great tombs were constructed to remember dead rulers. In Egypt the Ptolemaic rulers followed this useful tradition after the death of Alexander the Great. All great tombs and temples were a memorial to the greatness of the rulers who built them. Alexander was first entombed in Memphis on the order of the first Ptolemy, after his mummified remains were diverted from Babylon. His body was then taken to Alexandria and put in two tombs, the second one having members of the Ptolemaic dynasty alongside as a statement of status. Julius Caesar and Octavian both visited Alexander’s tomb to pay their respects, as such a pious display was a good way of demonstrating their own claims to greatness."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ita_training_grounds"	"As the art of warfare developed among the Italic peoples, tactics became more organised and required disciplined training in order to carry them out. For the Samnites, being a soldier was an integral part of the their lifestyle. Youth first trained for military service by serving as gatekeepers. Holidays were often celebrated with war-games, a practice later adopted by Rome. Another Samnite ‘invention’, later adopted by the Romans, was the manipular system. After a series of defeats using the Greek phalanx, culminating in the defeat at Caudine Forks, the Romans adopted this more flexible system, which better prepared them for fighting on the local terrain."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pun_iberian_Nabia_flavour"	"Nabia was an Iberian goddess of rivers and waters, occupying a similar position to the Roman Jupiter within the Iberian pantheon. Although chiefly a goddess, she had both female and male aspects, and was possibly two entirely separate gods. Primarily worshipped in the Lusitanian heartland, Nabia was revered throughout the northwest of the peninsula. In fact, the Navia, Neiva, Nabao and Avia rivers in modern-day Spain and Portugal are all named for her, signifying the goddess' longstanding importance as a one who represented the nourishment and health brought forth from flowing waters."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Quartermaster_flavour"	"Armies have always been more than just the men in the ranks. Provision of weapons, armour, supplies and camp materials was essential. Almost any workshop could make axes, javelins and spears, arrows and lead sling bullets, or simple leather armour, but making supplies in sufficient quantity needed central organisation. More complex equipment often required skilled blacksmiths working in better shops. A good sword needed time and skill to make, as did high-quality armour. Siege equipment could be constructed on site, but there was always a need for specialised parts. It was relatively easy to find timber, but the ironwork and sinew 'springs' needed might be harder to find on campaign. These pieces would be created in advance in specialised central workshops."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Farmers_market_flavour"	"Long before the Romans began their advance northwards the tribes of Gaul, Germania and Britannia were trading goods with the Mediterranean world. The Roman writer Strabo commented that trade with far-off Britannia was far more profitable than the revenue that could be collected should the place ever become a Roman province. The complex timber trackways discovered all over Europe also hint at trade links between tribes. As well as land transport, many tribes developed river vessels and used the Danube, Rhine, Rhones, Seine, Loire and Po rivers to transport their goods. It is also known that there were trade links between the tribes of Britannia and those of Northern Gaul, so they must have possessed ocean-going vessels, though remains of these have yet to be discovered."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Shrine_of_Minerva_flavour"	"Poetry, art, science, medicine, weaving and crafts all came under the auspices of the goddess Minerva. Her temples were meeting places for craftsmen, poets and actors. Above all she was known as the goddess of wisdom and, as such, had influence on every aspect of Roman life. Daughter of Jupiter, born not from a mother but from his head, Minerva was a major deity and governed thinking, calculating and the assessment of any situation. She was very important both in peace and war and many leaders asked her for cunning in battle. This was often repaid by war booty being given to her temples after victory. Statues of her show a brave maiden with helmet, shield and a coat of mail. As with many of the Roman gods, other cultures were seen as having their own local counterparts to Minerva. In Britain, for example, she was aligned with Sulis. The only surviving temple to Minerva is in Chester, England."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Shrine_of_baal_hammon_flavour"	"Ba’al Hammon was first among the Carthaginian gods. Depicted as a bearded man with curling ram horns, he was a sky god, responsible for storms and weather. His sphere of influence therefore was directly linked to seafaring and farming, both of which were important to a sea-going empire and a nation on the edge of a desert. His temples were always open to the sky. In Carthage itself the main sanctuary was Jebel Bu Kornein, a great hill overlooking the bay. Here incense and sacrifices were offered to Ba’al. Stories of children being sacrificed in his flames were probably wildly exaggerated by Roman writers, although Carthaginians were conscious of the need for sacrifice to be sincere. Ba’al may well have a connection to fire, as 'Hammon' may well refer to the Phoenician word for brazier."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_ita_city_center_touto"	"The Samnite system of ‘touto’ – similar to the Roman ‘civitas’ except in scale – dictated the nature of their political and administrative life. Each touto was a mini-republic within the whole, with its own council and assemblies. Each chief councillor held the title ‘Meddix Tuticus’ (literally ‘community manager’), with representatives were elected by the populace and open criticism of the individuals holding power was encouraged in the true spirit of democracy."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_east_navalbuff"	"The Sassanid Empire was a formidable ground force thanks to its superior cavalry. When it came to nautical matters, however, the scene was a bit different. During their rule, the Sassanid dynasty failed to establish naval superiority, especially early on, and possibly because there was little need for them to do so. In spite of that, a naval command was established by the Shahanshah, led by an admiral with the title 'navbed'. It is quite possible that he oversaw every aspect of the Sassanid fleet, from shipbuilding, crew recruitment and training, to organisation and coordination of their force. Again, this might have not been too demanding a task, as an intriguing fact about their maritime practices is the recruitment of expendable prisoners into its naval crews, which speaks volumes regarding the harsh conditions they were expected to face."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Military_Wharf_flavour"	"Rome is seen by most people as a military power not a naval one. The navy, though, was a key part of Roman power, acting in support of the army and carrying it to war. The Roman Navy was in action all over the Empire, even on major rivers like the Danube and the Rhine, and had facilities nearly everywhere as ships needed constant care to keep them ready for action. Dry docks had been built in the ancient world as far back as 200BC, and the Romans had many of them to build, repair and maintain their fleet or 'classis' across the Empire. Roman citizens didn't have to work as oarsmen, and auxiliaries serving as such were given citizenship after 26 years of service. The Romans could be excellent fighting sailors, as demonstrated by Octavian's fleet at the Battle of Actium in 31BC. Unfortunately, the enemy were other Romans under Mark Antony."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_lead_chain"	"Found in abundance across the whole world, lead has been used by people for thousands of years as it is extremely soft, malleable and easy to extract by smelting. The Egyptians used it to glaze pottery and the Babylonians and Assyrians used lead sheets for construction. However, the Romans were the greatest exploiters of it, with an estimated annual output of eighty thousand tonnes. Lead was extracted from crushed and smelted galena ore, a by-product of silver mining. The Romans used 'plumbum' to line their baths and make their water pipes, hence the English word 'plumber'. Even the gladiators in the Coliseum used lead as knuckle covers."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_black_sea_greek_water_asclepius"	"Asclepius was a god of medicine in the Greek pantheon. He is depicted carrying a staff with a snake wrapped around it, which is often confused for the Caduceus staff carried by Hermes. He was the son of Apollo and a mortal woman, and became so skilled as a healer that he overshadowed his both his father and the centaur, Chiron. However, this was ultimately his undoing, as Zeus executed him with a judgement bolt after Asclepius raised people from the dead, angering Hades. Asclepius was revered in Pergamon, with a sanctuary at the head of the Acropolis. People would travel to the 'Asclepium' to heal and relax, with some saying that the god came to them in their dreams, offering wisdom and a way to cure their illness."	"True"

Ownership and husbandry of exotic breeds cost money and time, and was a pursuit of the wealthy and the noble. War horses, swift racers, beasts of burden, or exotic war elephants, signs of an owner's conspicuous wealth. Horses were essential to eastern armies after the Greco-Persian Wars, replacing the functions of light chariots. Ancient cavalry could be roughly divided into two types: light skirmishers to harry the enemy at a distance, or heavily-armoured troops to engage other cavalry, outflank and then exploit the weak points of enemy formations. As well as horses, camels, dogs and elephants were conditioned and trained for war, providing shock elements for eastern generals. Camels were prized because of their ability to terrify horses by their unfamiliar smell alone!"	"True"

The building dominated the city. Lavishly decorated with marble, the Colosseum allowed Romans to see everything and everyone they had conquered. Built by Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus, this huge symbol of Rome’s might and riches took less than a decade to build. The ruins of today are only the concrete core, stripped of marble over the centuries. Forty-two Emperors saw an estimated 700,000 deaths in the Colosseum, watching everything from Christians to mass battles to elaborate executions. And all this was done in the name of entertainment! Clever staging allowed adventurous showmanship: sea battles were re-enacted by flooding the arena; exotic beasts such as giraffes, crocodiles and tigers were regularly hunted; and some 36 trapdoors meant a huge variety of surprises for the gladiators battling on the sand."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_nur_religion_tomb_of_giants"	"The ‘Tombs of Giants’ are so-named due to their dimensions, and are very typical of Sardinia's megalithic period. Usually they were structured in a semi-circular shape, believed to symbolise a bull's horns. Almost always there was an enormous granite stele in the middle of the semi-circle, with a small opening on the base. Nuragic tombs were usually communal in that they contained the graves of up to two hundred people. Another curious aspect, proving that the Nuragic people clearly had good knowledge of the celestial cycles, is that most of the tombs are oriented towards the constellation of Taurus, and precisely the brightest star, ‘Alpha Tauri’."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Windcatcher_flavour"	"Windcatchers bring cooling breezes to the heart of a building, and can take a variety of forms. Typically, they consist of a capped tower with one open face directed towards the prevailing wind. This directs wind down the tower, providing natural airflow and therefore a cooling effect throughout the building. Some types have shutters on each side to take advantage of any gust or breeze. Underground shabestans use qanats to provide better cooling: a windcatcher opened whilst facing away from the wind creates low pressure to draw cool air up the tower from a water-cooled qanat below. In the ancient east, shabestans were often used to cool large communal spaces, but also for storage of goods and produce that needed to be kept cool. In contrast, the above ground yakhchals, large-domed evaporative coolers, were used purely for storage and could be kept cool enough for ice, even in the summer heat."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_barb_navalbuff"	"It was a rare occurrence for the barbarian tribes to brave the waves, so when they did it was a great shock to the civilised folk surprised by, and entirely unprepared for, their lightning raids. Barbarian sea crews were trained to fight and survive on land, their vessels being little more than a means to transport loot to their own holds. If a raider survived a few expeditions he could pass his seafaring knowledge on to future 'sea wolves'. Some of the captured slaves were seasoned sailors and were glad to share what they knew of shipbuilding and seafaring in exchange for a degree of freedom granted by their captors."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_gaul_carthage_mine_flavour"	"Silver, lead, copper, and their monopoly of the tin trade led Carthage’s Phoenician forebears to found their original north African colonies. In turn, much of Carthage’s great wealth and trading power stemmed from the possession of mines in Iberia and Corsica. Silver from the Iberian Peninsula was especially prized and essential for paying off the mercenaries Carthage employed as the mainstay of its armies. When the aftermath of the First Punic War resulted in the loss of both Sicily and Sardinia, it was the Iberian silver mines that enabled Carthage to both pay its reparations to Rome and fund Hannibal’s later incursions against the rival city-state. So rich were these deposits, that a single mine alone provided Hannibal with 300 pounds, or over 1,000 Roman talents, of silver per day."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pun_iberian_Bandua_flavour"	"Bandua derives from the word 'bendh', meaning 'to bind or fasten'. Although little physical evidence survives, it is commonly believed that she was worshipped by the Iberians as their goddess of deals and oaths, spreading from the north right down to the tip of the peninsula as tribes migrated over time. However, it seems her associations changed with geography; in some areas Bandua is associated with water too, as indicated by the springs and lakes all over modern-day Spain and Portugal that are named after her. Also, the name is generally associated with fortified areas, indicating a connection to war, possibly through the treaties that mark the formal end of conflict. Bandua, like Nabia, existed as two aspects: the male Bandus and the female Bandua (who was likely created later) and can thus be compared to other Celtic deistic pairs of the same period."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Cattle_pens_flavour"	"In Celtic society a man’s wealth was measured by the size of his herd, making cattle an important symbolic part of everyday life. Large herds provided milk, meat and strong bulls to pull ploughs and act as sacrifices to the gods. In ancient Ireland the freshly-flayed skin of a bull was worn to induce a sacred sleep that allowed druids to have visions of their future king. The breed of cow farmed by the majority of ancient Celts is thought to be the now-extinct Celtic Shorthorn. Archaeologists studying Danebury hill fort in England have looked at the animal remains found within the fort and concluded that two thirds of the meat eaten there was probably Celtic Shorthorn beef."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_east_military_buff_cavalry"	"A source of food, a symbol of wealth, a beast of burden and a tool of war, the horse was one of the most versatile commodities in the ancient world. Equus ferus’ role was tied to its physical form – the small, early horse could only be used to pull primitive chariots. Larger, faster horses were later bred and used by skirmishers to chase down troops, but it was not until the development of more muscular breeds that shock troops such as the Macedonian Companions and cataphracts came into being. Their long lances and heavy armour made these new-style heavy cavalry units deadly against infantry, fundamentally changing the nature of warfare forever."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_iron_chain"	"According to early documentation it was the Hittites who first used iron to forge weapons whilst fighting the Egyptians. Despite being more brittle and variable in quality than bronze, iron was cheaper and more abundant so rulers could arm large armies of peasants more economically. It was used to make spear and arrow heads, swords and armour. Its versatility and availability made it very popular throughout the ancient world. Moulds were rarely used in the ancient world to create iron weapons. Instead they employed a laborious method of smelting ore at temperatures higher than those needed for copper. The iron was then broken free from the waste slag and shaped during a lengthy process of firing and pounding."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_east_water"	"Canals were a common feature of regions without major waterways or where the annual flow was insufficient to supply farms and communities with the water needed to sustain life. Whatever the source, water often needed to be carried great distances to reach the people, animals and farmland that depended on it. As a precious commodity in hot climates, water control was a matter of vital importance. Reservoirs were used to store water for particularly dry times. Eventually, sophisticated water channelling systems were developed and carefully graded to manage flow. Once the water had reached its destination, sluices directed the water to the surrounding farms."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Shrine_of_Mercury_flavour"	"Mercury was the god of travel and trade and therefore considered important to the success of the Empire. Son of Jupiter from an illicit relationship with Maia, goddess of the clouds, Mercury watched over 'proper' merchants and 'less formal merchants' in the shape of thieves! Both groups prayed to him for favourable outcomes to their commercial transactions. Mercury was closely identified with the Greek god Hermes. The planet Mercury was believed to be the fastest moving by Roman astrologers. There was a temple to Mercury in the Circus Maximus because of his association with speed, and charioteers would pay homage before races. Worshipped across the Empire, he later became popular with Celtic and Germanic tribes. As the messenger of the gods, Mercury is still associated with communication and news and many modern newspapers use his name. Today he is still distantly recalled in the name of 'Mesurii dies' (Wednesday) and the day dedicated to him: 'Mercredi' in French and 'Miercoles' in Spanish."	"True"

While the Egyptian pyramids may be the most famous in the world, the Meroe pyramids, in modern-day Sudan, are incredibly impressive ancient structures in their own right - resting places that truly befitted the divine kings and queens of Nubia. Meroe, the capital of the Kingdom of Kush, was ruled by the Nubian kings for around six hundred years. Up to 4,600 years old, the pyramids at Meroe were built in the 'Nubian-style', made unique by their steep slopes and small bases."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_all_garrison_town"	"A garrison serves many purposes. In the large empires of the ancient world, it was often easy for a subjugated people to question the authority of an absent and unseen ruler. In most cases a small garrison provided a reminder of who was really in control, often forestalling any rebellious activity before it even began. Furthermore, this arrangement was beneficial for both the local economy, as the soldiers looked for opportunities to spend their wages, and for the soldiers themselves, to whom life in a peaceful garrison was infinitely preferable to being on campaign. Many large and prosperous towns owed their success to the presence of a garrison."	"True"

These were not just customs or duties requiring only lip service. Gods and ancestral spirits were real and were important in daily life. Veneration could take many forms, such as offerings to household gods and ancestors through to public festivals and rites. Belief and practice varied from worship of the Greek or Persian gods to Zoroastrianism and included monotheistic beliefs such as Judaism. The common thread was a desire for people to come together and express faith in the divine. Shrines and temples, tombs and mausoleums, were constructed to appease and glorify the relevant heavenly forces."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_gold_chain"	"Gold has attracted and fascinated humans since it was first found as a deposit in mountain rivers. As a malleable metal it can be made into virtually anything decorative from jewellery to armour plating, yet its softness makes it useless for tools or weaponry. It is also relatively simple to extract gold from rock as it is pure and easily distinguishable. Initially Rome and Greece had only small deposits but through their conquests gained access to greater supplies. Slaves would toil over six hundred feet below ground in mines that were exploited until they collapsed. The Greeks prized gold so highly that they attempted to turn base metals into gold, an ‘art’ known as alchemy."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_seleucid_Paradise_of_Daphne__flavour"	"Built in Antioch, the 'Paradise of Daphne' was a series of pleasure gardens and parks. In a dry, desert country, any garden would be a welcome place to relax. Never ones to be backward in publicly condemning the vice and immorality of others, the Romans saw the place as a sink of depravity and debauchery. It was just the sort of place Romans would never be interested in, not even a little bit. Oddly, given the Roman attitude, Daphne was not a wanton or lewd figure in myth, rather the reverse. The story of Daphne and Apollo is not a particularly happy one. The god Apollo, who liked to think of himself as something of an archer, offended Eros, who then took two of his arrows and shot them at Apollo. The gold-tipped arrow caused almost-insatiable lust in whoever it struck, in this case Apollo. The lead-tipped arrow caused a horror of all acts of love or intimacy, and this struck Daphne. Apollo pursued Daphne to slake his appetites, while the poor nymph did her best to get away. As she wearied of the chase, Daphne appealed to the river gods for help. Her father transformed her into a laurel tree; Apollo, still desperately in lust, claimed the laurel as his special tree, so accounting for the use of laurel leaves in the worship of Apollo."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Shieldmaker_flavour"	"The shieldmaker and armourer of Rome were highly skilled workers and crucial to military success. The protection used by the Roman army developed over many centuries of campaigning as tactics and formations changed. Early Roman troops had to pay for their own war gear, and what a man could afford determined his position in the battle line. The classic armour of the legionary only developed after the reforms of Gaius Marius, and was largely standardised for many centuries. Body armour was made in one of four types: lorica squamata, or scale armour; lorica segmentata made up of metal strips; lorica hamata made of chainmail; and lorica plumata, expensive mail armour usually reserved for leaders. However, production was by hand so many variations occurred and often different types of armour would be used on the battlefield as families and Legions would 'make do and mend'."	"True"

As lord of storms, Ba'al Zephon was revered for his control of the howling winds, churning seas and driving rain. It was his control of the rains that saw him linked to agriculture and cultivation. Torrential rain could destroy crops but, if Ba'al Zephon was appeased, the rains would fall as gentle showers, allowing the people to grow the crops they needed."	"True"

An incredible feat of architecture, the dome and its large opening (or oculus) at the top represent the heavens. This stunning temple, originally built by Marcus Agrippa and rebuilt after fire by Hadrian, allowed the Roman people to come and pay homage to all of the immortals at once. Romans believed in many different gods and goddesses, and this was a temple to all the gods of Rome, where they could all be honoured properly. Many of the Roman gods came from the early Italian tribes, and some adopted very different heavenly duties: Mars was god of spring originally, but became the god of war."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_carthage_Wells_flavour"	"Water was a precious resource in Carthage. The people needed it, agriculture needed it, and the city's famous dyeing, tanning and textile industries needed it. Carthage, as well as its colonies and farms, made extensive use of wells and cisterns dug deep into the ground to draw and store water. Enclosed cisterns, covered to reduce the loss of water due from evaporation, were essential for regulating water supply, creating reserves for use in dry spells that would otherwise devastate crops and livestock. These were assisted by the use of underground water systems, like qanats, and the networks created by the Garamantes to 'mine' water."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Hieron_ton_megalon_theon_flavour"	"The 'Sanctuary of the Great Gods' was a sacred site from the 7th century BC. The most important religious retreat for the Hellenic peoples was on Samothrace in the northern Aegean Sea. The old gods celebrated there were so mysterious and deliberately enigmatic that their names were never written down and were known only to cult initiates. The Great Mother, who embodied the concepts of fertility and the Earth, was central to the rites; she would later be personified as Gaia. Prayer and animal sacrifice were the usual forms of worship. Among the initiates who took vows were the historian Herodotus, Lysander of Sparta, and Philip V of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great. The Hieron itself was the largest unsupported room in the ancient world. Later, the site would include other temples, shrines, and a theatre."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Travellers_lodge_flavour"	"Extensive diplomatic and trade networks in the Hellenic and Mediterranean world meant travel was common amongst the merchant classes. Inns, or 'pandocheion', often in or close by the agora, developed to meet the needs of well-heeled travellers, offering places to stay while on business. Travellers brought wealth into the cities and, as artistic, learning and philosophical tastes were shared and spread, contributed much to the Hellenisation of the Mediterranean coast. The philosopher Strabo, born around 64BC, was a typical Greek traveller. His extensive wanderings, the basis for his 17-volume Geographica, took him from his native Pontus, across Egypt and into the Kingdom of Kush, before he settled eventually in Rome."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_thracian_dionysus_flavour"	"Dionysus was the god of wine and its associated effects. His origins are shrouded in mystery - both the Greeks and the Thracians lay claim to Dionysus' discovery and patronage. The truth may be that the god was a fusion of a lesser member of the Greek pantheon with a more potent Thracian god, giving him his wide elemental array. This contention over his origin manifests in the shifting images that have been found. Originally, Dionysus was depicted as older, clothed and bearded. As Hellenisation took place, Dionysus became beardless and naked, adopting a more sultry and androgynous image, more in keeping with Greek notions of beauty. Dionysus is perhaps most famously known as Bacchus, a name that superseded Dionysus when he was adopted into the Roman pantheon. Another name for him is Eleuthorios, or 'the liberator', as he sets people free from their cares through music and drink."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Shrine_of_Jupiter_flavour"	"The temple to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Jupiter the Best and Greatest, was central to public religion in the city of Rome. Sacrifices were made there on many state occasions, and magistrates drew at least part of their authority from Jupiter. The god was an embodiment of much that was Roman, but he also was worshipped during the time of the Roman kings. This made Romans a little uneasy about his power during the Republican period, for they always had a suspicion of anything connected with kingship, even in something as Roman as their chief god. However, no Roman who wanted high office risked alienating or insulting Jupiter, at least in public. In a patriarchal society like Rome, where the power of the state was modelled on the power of a man as the head of household, it did not do at all to go against, or doubt portents from, the head of the divine household. If Jupiter threw a thunderbolt, all wise men paid attention!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_dacian_derzerlas_flavour"	"Derzelas, also known as the heroic 'Thracian Knight', was the god of the underworld, health and vitality. As with many of the Thracian gods, there are parallels between Derzelas and the Greek pantheon. Notably, there are many similarities with the Greek god Hades. They are even similar in appearance - both depicted as bearded men in heavy robes, or 'Himation'. Unlike Hades, however, Derzelas is also often depicted with a cornucopia – the horn of plenty, a symbol of abundance. Again, due to geographical location, Derzelas was also likely related to the deities of the Getae, such as Gebeleizis and Zalmoxis. Many terra cotta and lead statuettes of the god have been found in areas inhabited by the ancient Thracians, suggesting Derzelas was widely worshipped. Several temples were also dedicated to him, and games known as ‘Darzaleia’ were held in the god’s honour every five years. There is also evidence that he was worshipped well into the period of Thrace’s Roman annexation, as coins depicting Derzelas and the young Roman emperor, Giordan III, have also been unearthed."

When marching in enemy territory it was vital that the Roman army had specialised engineers with them to construct everything from bridges and fortifications to siege engines and roads. The establishment of a road network was crucial if it was to be supplied quickly and efficiently. Every legionary carried digging tools, but engineers brought expertise to the work party. Examples of extraordinary military engineering during campaigns include Julius Caesar’s bridge across the Rhine in 55BC and the wall and massive assault ramp built during the siege of Masada in AD73.

Originally developed to record taxes, writing quickly developed to include historical accounts, philosophies, religion and ideas. Cuneiform writing on clay tablets was used for thousands of years. Tablets were fired if a permanent record was needed. Over the centuries, tax records and administrative archives gave way to the great libraries and eventually academies, known in the east as daneshgah - the pre-cursor to the modern university."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Shrine_of_Vulcan_flavour"	"As a young god, Vulcan came between his parents, Jupiter and Juno, as they argued. Jupiter picked Vulcan up and threw him from the heavens. He crashed to the ground, leaving his leg badly deformed. After that, Vulcan shunned the company of the other gods and lived in the volcanic depths of Mount Etna. There he worked with the giant one-eyed Cyclopes forging weapons for gods and heroes alike. If Vulcan was not honoured he was given to stoking his forge too much, making Etna erupt! He was worshipped as the god of fire in both its destructive and useful forms. Those who wished to avoid harmful fires and those who used fire for work venerated the 'blacksmith of the gods'. In August, the most dangerous month for fires in and around Rome, live fish were thrown on fires lit along the River Tiber as part of the Vulcanalia. This was done to assuage Vulcan and protect the city. Often his fire temples were built outside the city because of his dangerous nature!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_City_centre_flavour"	"Palaces, administrative ministries, markets and traders were at the heart of every ancient city, all jostling for attention alongside great monuments and temples. Here, business was done and civic duties performed, while the masses were entertained and overawed by rituals, sports and spectacles. Although cities were sometimes laid out according to one man's vision, such as Antioch's grid system by the architect Xenarius, most cities developed over time to meet the immediate needs of their people. The results could be predictably messy and very human: with space at premium, new buildings were often constructed on top of older ones, adapting and changing their purpose."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Library_flavour"	"The Lykeion, or Lyceum, in Athens was a meeting place named for Apollo Lyceus, patron god of the grove in which it was built. It was best known as a place of learning due to Aristotle’s 'Peripatetic School' debating there. The great philosopher kept a large collection of scrolls, which formed the basis of this early library. Aristotle also taught the Pharaohs in Egypt how to organise their libraries. Public libraries were rare as most books were in the private collections of wealthy men. The first purpose-built one was at Alexandria and it held some 750,000 scrolls. By comparison, the library in Pergamum 'only' had some 200,000 scrolls in its stacks."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_celts_Nemeton_flavour"	"Trees were incredibly important to the tribal peoples of Europe: they provided building materials, fuel and sites of worship. The Celts use of tree groves as sacred spaces was well documented, and a little sensationalised, by Roman writers like Pliny and Lucan. They were described as mystical places where animals dared not tread, where the silence was all consuming and where every tree was stained with sacrificial blood. The Irminsul of the Germanic tribes were less well known, though it is thought they may have been tree trunks erected by the tribes in honour of their gods. Historians have related them to the ‘Pillars of Hercules’ discussed by Tacitus in his work 'Germania'. Unfortunately these 'pillars' were never actually seen by Roman eyes and have never been explained or described since."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Grove_of_Api_flavour"	"Api was a Scythian earth-mother goddess, and must have been an important figure in the pantheon, given what Herodotus says about her. As the earth goddess, Api's realm must have seemed endless to the nomads who roamed the steppes. As always, Herodotus could not resist recasting her in purely Greek terms for his readers, explaining her as being a version of Gaia, the primordial goddess of the whole earth. If this was an accurate analogy, then she would have been the mother of many other deities, and possibly even the birth-mother of Earth itself. Herodotus is silent about any particular rituals associated with Api, but it is fair to assume that animal sacrifices had their place with her as with the other nomad gods. Given that carefully modelled stags have been found in grave goods, there is a chance that these animals were held sacred and may well have been offered to Api."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_black_sea_greek_town_centre_5_rose_marl"	"Marl is a form of mudstone - material formed primarily of clay and calcium. It was used by some Hellenic colonies in lieu of traditional Greek construction materials. During antiquity marl was the term applied to a variety of sedimentary materials formed in areas of freshwater. The Bosporan region on the northern shores of the Black Sea, and around the inlet Maeotis Swamp, had an abundance of this material, so much so that the Hellenic settlers used it instead of Greek sandstone. When it naturally mixed with red coralline algae from the freshwater marl gave buildings an interesting rose hue. This made the architecture of the Cimmerian Kingdom unique and, to some, profoundly beautiful."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Shrine_of_Neptune_flavour"	"Neptune was not only a god of the seas, but of water generally. It was a foolish sailor who did not at least honour Neptune a little before embarking. The Mediterranean could be a treacherous sea, and ships could easily be carried away by currents and dashed to pieces on hidden shoals. Neptune, the brother of Jupiter, was quite definitely the 'King of the Sea' and therefore important to any Roman maritime ambitions. While it is tempting to see the Romans as a land power, much of their influence and success was based on naval strength in the Mediterranean world. The chief festival of Neptune, the Neptunalia, took place in the heat of summer at a time when the rivers in central Italy must have been at their lowest after winter and the spring thaw. This must have seemed an excellent time to celebrate Neptune’s bounty, if only to ensure more water in future months! Neptune was also the god of horse racing, which partly explains why dolphin-shaped markers showed the number of laps run in races at the Circus Maximus."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_barb_coin_maker"	"While the use of coinage probably originated in Lydia, Asia Minor, the Greeks rapidly adopted and used it to pay for barbarian mercenaries and goods from the west. Although these coins had little meaning in barbarian economies, they were most likely seen as exotic symbols of status. Thus when the arts of striking and casting arrived, they were primarily used to make exact copies of Greek coins - especially the common Philippian and Alexandrian motifs. When the economic significance of coins became apparent to them, local barbarian smiths began to incorporate native styles and increasingly abstract subjects such as giants, severed heads and gods."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pel_shrine_muses"	"In Greek mythology, the Muses were goddesses considered to be the source of inspiration for all literature, music and knowledge. Most typical accounts say that there were nine, all of them (somewhat unsurprisingly) daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, the personification of memory. Although broadly associated with knowledge, the Muses themselves were each connected to a discipline; science, philosophy, art and mathematics, as well as collectively representing 'mousike' (from which we draw the English word 'music'). The original three Muses were all worshipped at the springs on the eastern slopes of Mount Helion, the festival of 'Mouseia' being held there every five years in the goddesses' honour."	"True"

These ranged from the purely decorative courtyards where the elite could take their ease to more functional spaces growing herbs or fruits. It is possible that, as early as the 4th century BC, grapes were grown within the city. Much like their Phoenician forebears and their Persian counterparts, Carthaginians saw gardens as a symbol of power and prestige. A seemingly-impossible garden in an arid environment demonstrated great wealth and good taste."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_illyrian_anzotica_flavour"	"Many Illyrian deities appear on monuments erected during the Roman era, which means the Romans considered their gods and goddesses to be aspects of those within their own pantheon; the same god under a different guise. This is certainly true of Anzotica, who often appears in the traditional image of the goddess Venus. As the goddess of love, aspects of Venus were worshipped from Rome itself to the furthest reaches of the empire, by many different cultures. Many great military leaders claimed that the personal favour of the Goddess of Love was responsible for their successes. For instance, friends and adversaries Pompey and Julius Caesar both attributed their victories to Venus Victrix; Pompey dedicated the Theatre of Pompey and his triumph of 54BC to her, while Caesar took things one step further, by claiming common divine ancestry. This became a family tradition among the Julii and as such was carried on by his adopted heir, Augustus."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pel_megas_limen"	"Although there had long been a port on the site of Piraeus, the Athenian naval dockyards were originally centred around Phaleron, about five kilometres away. In the 6th century BC however, the Athenian tyrant Hippias acknowledged Piraeus' strategic importance, fortifying the steep hill of Munichia around the rocky outcrop. Several years before the decisive Battle of Salamis Athens moved its naval base to Piraeus, and in the battle's wake the port became its premier naval dockyard. After the Persians destroyed the defences around Piraeus, Athens began constructing the 'Long Walls', a series of defensive fortifications connecting the port to the city. They were completed in 471BC despite opposition from Sparta, enabling safe and continuous passage from the city to the coast."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_barbarian_Storage_pit_flavour"	"Storing food for the winter months or for use during sieges was of vital importance. The tribes of Gaul, Germania and Britannia employed a number of techniques to keep people fed beyond harvest time. Storage pits were common to many of the tribes. Examples have been found in settlements all over Europe and have actually helped archaeologists to piece together the diets of the people who ate from them. Another common find is a primitive underground larder, the souterrain - known as a fogou in Cornwall. Most souterrains have timber roofs but the fogou at Carn Euny has a roof made of heavy stone slabs. Alongside the Halliggye fogou, it is one of the largest stores from the period ever discovered and runs for 65 metres underground."	"True"

Skills were perfected and guilds were set up to teach and protect the profits against outside competition. Blacksmithing, pottery and weapon-making were all trades handed down from father to son. All the skills needed by a city would be found in small workshops alongside homes and other businesses. Some trades and skills, however, were less than pleasant for the workers and their neighbours: in a fuller’s workshop the art of whitening the Roman togas of the elite was done with urine collected in receptacles in the streets. The fuller spent his day treading the urine into the cloth with his bare feet. The clothes were then rinsed and sulphur was applied to rid them of any lasting stains. Finally after drying, they would then be ready for return to their owners, as good as new."	"True"

Whether based on earlier Persian designs, such as the administrative buildings and the royal palace complex at Persepolis, at the heart of the Achaemenid Empire, or constructed in Hellenistic fashion by Alexander’s successors, such as the Seleucid palaces at Antioch, these buildings were designed to awe. The palaces were also hives of activity, from which the day-to-day running of the cities and provinces was orchestrated, and diplomacy, politics and wars were planned."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_greek_Shrine_of_hermes_flavour"	"Hermes, the herald and messenger of the gods, was often depicted as a handsome young man wearing winged sandals and carrying the herald’s staff, the kerykeion, with two serpents wrapped around it. Of all the gods, Hermes was the one who moved most easily between the mortal world and Olympus, home of the immortal gods. Perhaps this accounted for his work escorting the souls of the dead to the afterlife\? Hermes was also the god of travellers, merchants and, because he was fond of trickery and cunning, thieves. Perhaps, again, because hard bargaining and haggling in the marketplace were almost an art form, it was difficult to tell merchants and chiselling tricksters apart! More honestly, Hermes was also the patron of athletes, and was the inventor of the foot race. The Romans considered him to be the same as Mercury."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_dacian_gebelizis_flavour"	"There is very little information available regarding the Getae god, Gebeleizis. However, it is known that he was the god of storms and lightning, who manifested himself through thunderbolts and storms. Due to their geographical proximity, there are parallels between many of the Getae’s deities and the Greek and Thracian pantheons, most notably Zeus. The Greek historian Herodotus said that some Getae believed Gebeleizis to be the same thing as their supreme deity, Zalmoxis, and also the Thracian god Zibelthiurdos. This is borne out by both gods’ connection to the Celtic god of storms, Taranis, via very similar etymological roots. All surviving depictions of Gebeleizis portray him as a handsome man, sometimes (but not always) with a beard. His worship is another example, as in the case of the Norse, Celts and Huns, of veneration of the great open sky - its violent extremes of weather being far beyond tribal understanding."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Hamlet_flavour"	"Small farming settlements were the backbone of ancient civilisations in the east, feeding the great cities such as Antioch and Seleucia. Situated to exploit good land, fishing, mining or quarrying, defence was often too expensive to be more than a secondary consideration. As the populations of the great cities increased, surplus food from these farming communities became essential. As small military garrisons were positioned to protect valuable resources and trade routes, there was a slow growth of many hamlets into towns, as people and trade passed."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Fountains_flavour"	"To Romans, fountains were much more than mere civic decorations. As part of the most complex water distribution system in the ancient world they were a mark of Roman civilisation and technical superiority. After the excavation of Pompeii, destroyed by the explosion of Mount Vesuvius in AD79, many fountains were found preserved by ash. They were placed throughout the city, enjoyed by citizens and slaves alike. In Rome, the writings of Consul Sextus Julius Frontius mention that there were thirty grand fountains throughout Rome by AD98 and nearly 600 public basins. Pressure to drive the water up and out was achieved through the clever use of gravity and different sizes of lead piping. Pliny the Younger describes one household where the fountains sprayed their water only when the guests sat down to dinner on their ingeniously designed seats!"	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_wine_chain"	"Wine has been a big part of western civilisations for thousands of years. The growing and fermenting of grapes began as early 7000BC in what is now the Caucasus. However, much of modern wine culture derives from the practices of the ancient Greeks. To the ancient peoples wine was not so much a pastime as a religion: the goddess Geshtinana in Egypt, Bacchus in Rome and Dionysus in Greece all looked over the produce of the fermented grape. Wherever the Romans conquered they also traded, settled and drank, which accounts for the great spread of viticulture throughout the empire years and the establishment of the major wine regions and grape varieties we know today. However the ancients would have thought us barbaric for drinking wine undiluted; a civilised culture always mixed at least one part wine to two parts water."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_barb_religious_Teiws"	"Teiwaz' or 'Tyr' was the Germanic God of War and the original sky-father deity until Wodanaz discovered the runes of power. Among the Gothi of the south and east, Teiwaz was known as 'Teiws'. He was the only god brave enough to try and tie down the huge wolf, Fenrir, binding it with 'Gleipnir' - the 'Fooler' - an unbreakable rope crafted by dwarves. However, he lost his hand during the struggle when the savage beast bit it off. Destined to fall at Ragnarok, the last great battle of the gods, and killed by the hound of Hellheim, 'Garm', Teiwaz demanded courage and honour from his followers, and warriors would swear allegiance to their leaders through oaths to Teiwaz. The Germans believed he held so much sway over a battle's outcome, that they sacrificed spoils and prisoners in his name - the Hermunduri tribe, for example, are thought to have made human sacrifices to Teiwaz. Away from the battlefield, arguments would be put to him to decide, usually through trial by combat, with the victor thought to have secured his patron god's favour."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_3c_barb_religious_Gaut"	"Literally meaning 'the Raging One', 'Wodanaz' or 'Wotan' was the chief of all the gods in the Germanic pantheon. Equated with Odin in Norse mythology, Wodanaz was the foremost of the Aesir and somewhat of a complicated deity. As the son of giants, he presided over wisdom, philosophy, art, and poetry. Wodanaz sacrificed himself to himself by hanging, dangling from the World Tree for 9 days and nights. His reward was learning powerful songs and knowledge of the 24 runes of power. Wodanaz also attained knowledge by giving up one of his eyes in return for a drink from the 'Well of Wisdom'. Seen as the creator of the German people and the Lord of Magic, Death and Prophetic Power, he was thought to bestow knowledge, wisdom and even berserker fury to those who paid homage. According to historical sources, the Gothic people worshipped a deity named 'Gaut', whom they claimed was their divine ancestor. Gaut may well have been another aspect of Wodanaz, and was sometimes referred to as 'Gautr' in the 'Poetic Edda' tradition from the 13th century onwards."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_thracian_sabazios_flavour"	"The Thracians worshipped Sabazios as the god of the sky, a nomadic horseman and one of the 'Thracian Heros'; a pantheon of gods always depicted on horseback. However, it appears that worship of Sabazios was not confined to Thrace. There is evidence that he was also connected to the Greek pantheon, with references found in Macedon and even as far east as Phrygia. The common thread between all worshippers of Sabazios, in any of his various guises, seem to be horses and horsemanship. Many steles and other artifacts have been found depicting him as a mounted warrior in the sky, armed with a staff and battling the serpent of the earth. As such, Sabazios was known as the 'sky father', and his worship was, as in many other ancient cultures, a way of showing reverence to the great, vast unknown above. For instance, the Huns, certainly, worshipped the 'everlasting sky' as their chief god, knowing him as ‘Tengri’. Zeus and Jupiter, the leaders of the Greek and Roman pantheons respectively, were also worshipped for harnessing the power of the sky and thunder, and using it to wrest power above all other gods. In fact, the 'zios' of Sabazios is the etymological equivalent of Zeus, further cementing the connection between them. Furthermore, Sabazios and the Norse god Odin are also linked. Known as the ‘all-father’, Odin also rode a horse, Sleipnir, much like the Thracian Heros."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Exotic_animals_flavour"	"Exotic animals were prized for display and sport and for their pelts and skins. Some, such as camels, dogs and elephants, were trained for battle. With careful handling, dogs and elephants could cause panic in undisciplined enemies; handled badly they could wreak havoc on friends too! Seleucus Nicator, 'the Victor', and the founder of the Seleucid Empire, gained 500 war elephants from a peace treaty with Emperor Chandragupta of Maurya. They proved decisive in Seleucus Nicator’s victory at the Battle of Ipsus in 301BC. The animal trade was highly lucrative; as the games held at Roman amphitheatres reached their peak, the arenas had an almost insatiable appetite for animal flesh. Some animal populations, even from beyond Rome’s boundaries, were driven to the edge of extinction to feed the spectacles, and eastern merchants were quite happy to take Roman coin."	"True"

Hephaistos, the god of smiths and Zeus’ son, split open his father’s skull and Athena sprang from the wound, a fully-grown woman. She is the patron of wisdom, intelligence, courage as well as the arts, civilised living, and just warfare. Athena often features in Greek myths as the protector and helper of heroes, in particular Odysseus, Perseus and Heracles, and especially when they used cunning rather than strength. She was therefore seen as goddess of military strategy and generalship. Despite her liking for heroes she remained chaste."	"True"

In one hymn, Apedemak is described as "One who sends forth a flaming breath against his enemies in this his name, Great of Power, who slays the rebels with (his) strength". In Nubian art of the period, the god was depicted as wearing a battle-dress of leather armour and carrying weapons, usually a bow and arrows. He was also shown slaying enemies or holding onto bound captives, who were restrained with cords around their necks."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_inv_rom_religious_ceres"	"‘Kerres’ (or ‘Ceres’) was widely worshipped in southern Italy and was the Roman goddess of agriculture, fertility and motherly relationships. She had the power to fertilise, multiply and fructify seeds. There was even a festival dedicated to her – the so-called ‘Cerealia’. Held in April, it was organised by the plebeian aediles and included a horse race, after which foxes were released in to the circus, their tails ablaze with lighted torches, which was possibly to cleanse the growing crops and protect them from vermin. In Rome itself, Ceres was also the central figure in the Aventine Triad, a joint cult of gods. She was so important to the Romans that during the great famine and economic recession of 496BC, when Rome was also at war with the Latin tribes, the dictator Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis vowed to construct a temple to Ceres, Liber and Libera on the Aventine Hill should the gods assist the Roman people in their predicament. At the time, it was considered that the gods had answered him, as the famine came to an end and the plebeians assisted in bringing the Latin conflict to an end in Rome's favour."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Latrines_flavour"	"For Romans relieving oneself was a communal activity. The seats in a public latrine could number as many as thirty built in a square formation. There was no segregation according to class either. If an aristocrat was caught short far from home and his body-slave had forgotten the chamber pot then he would sit alongside equestrian or plebeian in the same latrine. In any one of the 114 latrines found in Rome people would read, chat away and 'network' with each other. The poet Martial ridicules one man for hanging around in public toilets waiting for a dinner invitation! Continuing this sense of camaraderie the Romans also shared a communal sponge to clean up afterwards. The latrines were towards the bottom end of the extraordinary water system created by the Romans. After a latrine, water and its effluent contents went into the sewers."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Market_flavour"	"If shrines and temples are the soul of a human settlement, then its markets, bazaars and caravanserai are its stomach and heart. Commerce is essential to town and urban life, as well as continued prosperity and growth. Trade in goods and services makes all who take part richer, as long as it is honest. Purpose-built caravanserai show the importance of trade and the flow of goods and money. Great courtyards, surrounded by identical alcove-like stalls, were designed to accommodate travelling merchants and trade caravans. They acted as waypoints along routes like the Silk Road and the Royal Road, re-established by Darius the Great in Asia Minor. They provided shelter, water and fodder for pack animals, and secure places to conduct business."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Training_Field_flavour"	"As well as teaching combat skills, Roman army instructors focused on fitness, discipline and moral strength. Running, athletics, swimming and forced marches increased their fitness and mental toughness until a foot soldier was capable of travelling twenty Roman miles with a full pack in under five hours. Learning to march also prepared him for keeping formation under pressure on the battlefield. According to the historian Vegetius, marching was the most important part of a legionary’s training. To march at great speed in a disciplined fashion while keeping formation allowed the army to cover enormous distances and instilled qualities of teamwork and endurance. All of this, however, needed practice, practice and more practice under the watchful eye of the centurions."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Practice_Castrum_flavour"	"For any Roman legionary on the march in foreign parts the day did not end when their commander decided they had marched long enough. No matter how far they had come, when the legionaries reached their destination they then had to knuckle down and build a 'castrum' or camp. As befits Romans, these marching camps were not casual affairs. A suitable spot would be chosen and measured out to create an enclosed area of four Greek 'plethora' or 3600 square metres. A ditch would then be dug all around the perimeter and an earth rampart built up with a barricade of wooden stakes on top. Spaces for each maniple or cohort were assigned according to a standard plan. All this was done in under two hours and would provide considerable fortification while on the move. All this work needed practice, lots and lots of lovely practice, as centurions must have explained as they hit slacking legionaries with their vine sticks."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Aqueduct_flavour"	"Aqueducts carrying water across many miles from mountain rivers and lakes into cities were among the greatest Roman achievements. The Romans perfected a technology that cannot be improved upon even today. In Rome itself over 400 kilometres of aqueducts were built to supply water to public bath houses, fountains, drinking basins and latrines. The water was also used for agriculture, mining and other industries. The majority of aqueducts were buried in the ground but the iconic image remains a towering bridge-like structure stretching across the landscape. The largest was the Aqua Marcia, which was some 144 kilometres long and delivered 182 million litres every day. Water gushed down into the city: by AD200 eleven aqueducts delivered nearly 1400 litres per person each day. This is far more than the water supplied to the average modern city dweller today."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Herding_Ground_flavour"	"In the ancient world cattle were an expensive and precious commodity to any farmer, and people rarely ate them except during religious feasts. Instead, oxen were used as beasts of burden for transport and to work on farms, where their manure was also used to raise the crops. Cattle trading was big business; the size of a herd was an old measure of wealth from before coinage became standardised. Food production was one of the driving forces behind Roman expansionism. Wherever their armies went, they needed a continuous supply of animals for food to support them. It was because of this that Rome developed animal husbandry throughout its Empire in order to increase yields and feed its vast armies."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_rome_Coastal_Patrol_flavour"	"Coastal patrols were vital to protect the majority of trade routes around the Empire. The navy used smaller, faster ships such as biremes, and had naval garrisons along the coast to police the seas. Their main mission was safeguarding merchant ships against piracy, which was a huge problem in the Mediterranean. Julius Caesar himself was held for ransom by pirates in his youth; foolishly, they laughed at the young Caesar but, after the ransom was paid, he hunted down and crucified his captors! Eventually Rome did dominate the Mediterranean and the Romans, with a typical bit of arrogance, referred to the sea as 'Mare Nostrum' or 'Our Sea'."	"True"

"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Grove_of_Tabiti_flavour"	"In keeping with other tribal, clan or family-based cultures, the Scythians seem to have a reverence for 'hearth and home'. In their case, the personification of this idea was Tabiti, a mother-goddess figure, and the most important figure in their pantheon. According to Herodotus, who translated the goddess into a civilised, Greek frame of reference, Tabiti was the equivalent of Hestia, the ancient virgin-goddess of hearth, family and domestic life. He also mentioned that Tabiti was honoured, like all the gods with animal sacrifices. Sheep, cattle and horses were offered to her, but never pigs as these were, apparently, seen as unclean animals. In this, many ancient peoples were right, as a horribly large number of communicable diseases can be found in carelessly raised pigs. As might be expected of steppe nomads, offering horses in sacrifice was the surest way to the goddess’ favour."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_eastern_Dakhma_flavour"	"Excarnation, the removal of flesh by carrion birds, was a common form of funereal practice in the ancient world, and especially in the east. Bodies were placed on towers with high platforms and left for the birds and elements to consume, so that only the bones remained. These dakhma or 'towers of silence' were usually outside a settlement, as the bodies of the dead were considered unclean. Bones were eventually collected and placed in ossuaries, either within the tower or at a nearby shrine. In Zoroastrianism, where a body would contaminate the purity of earth and fire, its excarnated remains were placed inside a well-like structure known as an astudan; lime and rainwater were then used to disintegrate the bones. After being filtered through charcoal and sand, the water would be allowed to flow away."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_twr2_rome_dlc_nomadic_Nomad_Camp_flavour"	"Nomad peoples followed the seasons, with their herds, rather than having a settled lifestyle of farming. The word itself is a Greek term and, as might be expected of the civilised, settled Greeks, they did not approve of barbarous nomads in the slightest. Nomads, on the other hand, may not have had permanent settlements, but their lives were as full and rich as settled farmer or city dweller and probably healthier too, as they didn’t live in squalor. Nomadism is an extremely effective way of living off areas with scarce natural resources such as the steppes. As grazing is exhausted, the herds can be moved on and the land left to recover until the following year. It is also an extremely effective and ruthless way of raising warriors. The easiest way of harvesting scarce resources is, of course, to take them from someone else. The tribe who cannot protect their own livestock, property and kin soon ceases to exist. This also encourages the worst feature of nomad life for neighbouring, settled peoples: nomads will raid and steal from weak, sedentary folk because they are just another resource to be exploited."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_silk_chain"	"The trade in luxury textiles in the ancient world was extremely lucrative as clothing and decorative fabrics became a sign of status and prestige. Silk was the jealously guarded secret of the Chinese for over two thousand years. Once the Silk Road was opened in the 1st century BC it proved highly desirable and, although considered by some immoral and decadent, soon became very profitable. Despite this, western cultures did not obtain the secret of making silk for themselves until 550AD."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_illyrian_medaurus_flavour"	"Depicted as a warrior on horseback carrying a lance, Medaurus was the protector of the town of Rhizion. Located on the Bay of Kotor in present day Montenegro, this Illyrian settlement went on to become a Roman city. During the Illyrian Wars Rhizion was the capital of Queen Teuta’s empire - it was to here that she fled when Demetrius turned his coat and became a ‘friend of Rome'. Despite being known as the protector of Rhizion, no evidence of Medaurus' worship has been found there. In fact, the only reference to him was a dedication within the temple of Asclepius in the ruins of Lambaesis in Roman North Africa. This dedication was made, not by an Illyrian, but by a Roman senator, so it is likely the Romans considered Medaurus' protectoral qualities to be the equivalent of Asclepius' healing nature. The inscription beseeched the god to watch over the temple despite its distance from his homeland, something keenly felt by the Roman garrison stationed nearby."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pel_temple_apollo"	"Apollo defines the notion of Greek beauty - the 'kouros', or noble, nude, beardless young man - and is revered as one of the most important, and also most complex, of the Greek gods. He was another of Zeus' sons (the mother on this occasion being the Titan Leto) and the twin sister of the huntress god, Artemis. Artemis and Apollo are often depicted together; indeed, many thought his bow skills learned from his more-accomplished sister. The Temple of Apollo at Delphi is considered one of the earliest dedications to the god, adorned with motifs and epithets (such as "know thyself" that reference the Delphic Oracle and Apollo himself). Amusingly, unlike his father, Apollo was constantly failing in love, with one of his pursuits even choosing to become a tree rather than be with him."	"True"
"building_flavour_texts_flavour_pirates_dacian_pleistoros_flavour"	"Pleistoros was the Getae god of war. As in the cases of other Getae and Thracian deities, there is little known about him, but comparisons can be drawn with the gods of the neighbouring Greeks. For Pleistoros, the most likely parallel is with Ares, the Greek war god. Ares embodied the chaotic aspects of war, whereas Athena embodied the more considered, strategic elements of battle. It is also likely that Pleistoros was akin to Ares as, according to Herodotus, human sacrifices were offered to him in the same way. There is further evidence of human sacrifice in the pantheon of the nearby Illyrians, as King Cleitus sacrificed many human lives to Armatus,
