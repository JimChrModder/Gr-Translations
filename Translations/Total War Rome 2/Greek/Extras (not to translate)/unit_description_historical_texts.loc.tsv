They have an impressive history from their tribal beginnings, through their time as part of the New Kingdom of Egypt to the rise of their own empire, when the kingdom – or Kush – extended across large tracts of southern Egypt. They repelled multiple Roman advances, and even survived the sacking of their capital during the 1st century BC. Though their kingdom declined in late antiquity, the Kushites remained a geopolitical and military force to be reckoned with and were never absorbed into the Roman Empire. They were famed for their formidable archers, with man and bow working as one."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_kush_slave_slingers"	"Slavery was widespread in the ancient world. References can be traced back to the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi. The ambitious construction projects of the day, as well as the custom of enslaving war captives, were some of the reasons for the large slave population many states kept at the time. The Greek city-states, for instance, depended heavily on slave labour. Having had all their rights confiscated, slaves were considered the property of their owners and could be sold as such. In Egypt, slaves who worked within the royal households could be executed and laid next to their mummified masters in the burial chamber, to serve them in the afterlife. Slaves were widely-used by the Romans as well. As the Roman Empire expanded, slaves from all over the known world poured into the Apennine Peninsula. The more educated ones became tutors, some were sold into prostitution and some became trained gladiators. Spartacus, one such gladiator of Thracian descent, famously led a bloody revolt in 73BC, threatening Rome itself at one point, before being killed in battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Mob_Long"	"Throughout history the mob has played its part in the rise and downfall of kings and politicians: a many-headed beast to be tamed or inflamed. The Greek democracies and the Roman Republic were shaped by the perceived will of the people. This was never more evident than when a mob took to the streets, seeking vengeance, to overthrow tyranny, or to protect themselves from aggressors. Ill-equipped - armed only with tools or whatever makeshift weapon was to hand - what they lacked in skill at arms was made up for by their righteous anger and superior numbers. Against such violence, even regular troops could be overwhelmed in the confined space of a city. Mobs were no respecters of status: the great Epirot king, Pyrrhus, having seized the throne of Macedon was attempting to put down unrest in its subject city of Argos. Facing a mob, he was knocked down by a roof tile thrown by an old woman and momentarily stunned, giving an Argive soldier the chance to behead him on the spot."	"True"

The province remained an Achaemenid satrapy, exercising a degree of independence from Persia in exchange for its ultimate loyalty. Kilikia's strategic importance lay not just in its fertile plains, but in the great highway that ran through the centre of its lands, descending from the Anatolian plateau and through the narrow mountain passes known as the Cilician Gates to Syria and Persia beyond. In many ways, it could be said that Kilikia was the Persian gateway to Asia Minor; it was certainly defended fiercely. Ultimately the Kilikians sided with Cyrus the Younger when revolting against their Persian masters, only to be put down by Artaxerxes."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ita_Campanian_Cav_Long"	"From the 8th century BC, when Greeks settlers established trading posts along Italy’s eastern seaboard in the vicinity of modern-day Naples, the region of Campania was part of Magna Graecia. It remained so, a stalwart of Hellenistic civilisation, until its aggressive Samnite neighbours began to migrate from their mountainous homelands, displacing the Greek culture and language prevalent there. In a land famed for its sweeping landscapes - ideal for the breeding of strong horses - the emergent Campanian nobility developed their renowned cavalry. Carrying heavy javelins for skirmishing and swords for melee, they used speed, agility and flexibility of tactics to inflict damage on more heavily armed, and therefore slower moving, opponents. Following the Samnite Wars with Rome, around the beginning of the 3rd century BC, Campanians provided the basis of the Socii cavalry attached to Roman Legions. Well-trained in their people’s equestrian traditions, they were highly valued horsemen and greatly respected warriors."	"True"

The Thracians bred horses for racing and later improved the breed for warfare. Their horses were said to be larger and sturdier than those of the nomadic tribes to the north, and generally considered a match for most large Greek and Persian war horses. As cavalrymen, Thracians favoured speed and mobility above armour, making them well suited for tribal warfare of raids and skirmishing. When fighting as mercenaries and allies they were the perfect swift skirmishers for harassing enemies, often to the point of defeat and death, pelting a foe with javelins as they rode around at high speed."

An iron sword was a prestigious possession, so those who carried them were either of noble blood or were veteran followers. By following a noble, warriors were duty-bound to show dedication and valour. If he fell in combat, the noble’s men were expected to fight to the death.

Their most distinctive feature, and the one which gave them their name, was their bronze shield, emblazoned with the name of their king. Although fighting in the style of Alexandrian phalangites, they probably wore a uniform of Persian origin. This would include a reinforced cuirass of scales or stiffened linen, bronze helm, and probably a patterned tunic and trousers. Their main weapon was the sarissa, a pike of up to 22 feet in length. As this required both hands, a neck strap in addition to a loop over their left arm would support their heavy bronze shields. In close order, phalanxes, such as the Bronze Shields, presented an impenetrable wall to the front, pushing back or pinning an enemy so that it could then be flanked and broken by cavalry."	"True"

At his funeral, the grieving crowd hurled their belongings onto his pyre: the fire raged out of control and damaged the Forum. Grief soon turned to anger and the mob attacked the houses of Brutus and Cassius, two of Caesar’s assassins.

Similarly equipped, they carried the Macedonian 'xyston' lance, a two-handed thrusting spear of around four metres in length. They led their royal cavalry in the same heroic style as Alexander, setting an example at the head of the charge. Whilst besieging Sparta in 272 BC, Pyrrhus of Epirus learned of the death of his son. Channelling his grief and anger, he charged his cavalry headlong into a unit of elite Spartan infantry. Toppled from his horse, Pyrrhus fought hand-to-hand against the odds and survived to tell the tale. This approach to frontline combat meant he was held in great regard by his men, but eventually led to his death.

At times, their expansion threatened Carthage and Ptolemaic Egypt, who also prized their fierce warriors as mercenaries. A reliance on slaves and freemen of low birth, much like the Spartans, enabled the Garamantians to develop a skilled military elite famed for their horsemanship and four-horse chariots. Unfortunately, as the water ran out, so did the fortunes of the Garamantians.

The central handgrip and protruding metal boss meant that it could be used both defensively for protection and offensively to punch enemies in close combat.

He also improved the weapons and battle tactics of his existing forces, equipping his hoplites with long sarissa pikes, replacing the shorter hoplite spears that had been used for the last 500 years. The Spartan army that took to the battlefield after his reforms was comprised largely of citizen recruits well-versed in the tactics that had dominated Greek warfare since the rise of Macedon 100 years before. Its Macedonian-style phalanx was employed with some success, as Cleomenes’ forces initially countered the rising power of the Achaean League, but they were eventually defeated at Sellasia in 222BC.

Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or 'self' bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina to use well, the composite bow demanded respect, care and attention. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Egy_Nubian_Spear_Long"	"Considered by some modern archaeologists to be the birthplace of civilisation itself, the ancient kingdom of Nubia lay between Egypt and modern-day central Sudan. Although much of the country was inhospitable desert, the tributaries of the Nile that flowed through it had fertile valley basins and it was there that Nubian culture flourished. As well as being a crucial water source, the Nile was the main trade route to Egypt for African ivory, animals, incense and other exotic riches. Living in such close proximity to the great river, the Nubians became excellent sailors, which ensured their nation's wealth through trade. Being Egypt’s neighbour, Nubia also became, at times, its greatest enemy, and the population were often enslaved and used as soldiers. In 750BC, Nubians even managed to conquer Egypt, and ruled for one hundred years - such was the deep rivalry that existed between the two. Consisting mainly of mercenaries, Nubian armies were famed for their aggression and fearlessness on the battlefield. Nubian archers even defeated the Romans, and their spearmen fought both against and alongside Ptolemaic armies. Eventually, the greatest threat to Nubia came not from war, but from the humble camel. Its introduction in the 2nd century AD greatly increased the power of nomadic desert tribes, lessening the importance of the Nile as a trade route. Subsequently, the kingdom went into decline."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_ballista"	"According to Diodorus, the 'katapeltikon' or catapult was invented under the patronage of Dionysius I, tyrant of Syracuse, in 399BC. The weapon was not the result of a stroke of inventive genius, instead being inspired by an earlier mechanical weapon called the 'gastraphetes'. In its original form, the gastraphetes consisted of a powerful composite bow mounted transversely on a stock and resembling the later crossbow. Its stock had two crucial parts: the syrinx, to which the bow of the weapon was fixed, and the diostra, a shorter board that could slide back and forth. The end of the diostra was in turn attached to a claw for pulling back the bowstring, with a trigger to release it again. Machines such as this were known to the Greeks before the invention of the katapeltikon, but didn't replace the composite bow with a pair of torsion springs, considered to be a major design improvement. Dionysius is said to have fielded "catapults of all kinds", using them to great effect in his siege of Motya in 397BC. By the time of Alexander, in the latter part of the 4th century BC, catapults were a regular feature of Hellenistic armies."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Sarissa_Cav_Long"	"An early form of lance-like spear, most commonly associated with Hellenic cavalry, the xyston measured three and a half to four and a half metres in length. Consisting of an iron spear tip on a wooden shaft, the weight of the head was offset, like many Greek spears, by a bronze butt-spike. This may have helped with balance and in the hands of a skilled rider may have meant only one hand was required, as seen in the famous Alexander Mosaic from Pompeii. As most bronze alloys are heavier than iron this may have been possible, as the xyston’s balance point was towards the butt-spike. However, whether such lances were as effective when used one-handed, both in terms of force and accuracy, is debatable."	"True"

Stationed in Britannia, far from their native valleys in the Middle East, the Hamians were sent to protect the remote Roman province from barbarian raiders. These crack archers served several purposes. Undoubtedly an excellent defensive unit, they were able to shoot accurately over a considerable distance.

They were then treated as a subject state, eventually becoming formally allied to Rome following the disputes between Emperor Hadrian and Pharasmanes, the king of Kartli. Kartli did supply axemen as both mercenaries and auxiliaries to the Romans. In battle these axemen used one-handed axes that could inflict horrible wounds, and carried round shields.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_barbarian_heavy_raider"	"Most of the northern European tribes were not naval powers, but there were still able seafarers to be found amongst them. Shipbuilding techniques were well understood, so while many vessels were small leather-skinned boats for inland and inshore use, bigger sea-going vessels were also made. Shipwrights used heavy planking for hulls, stitched together and then fastened to a wooden skeleton to create sturdy craft able to cope with Atlantic conditions. Julius Caesar was surprised at the quality of the enemy ships when his fleet clashed with the Veneti from modern-day Brittany. The Veneti vessels had flat bottoms to cope with shallows, but were also of heavy oak construction to cope with rough seas. This made them tough opposition for Roman galleys, and capable of shrugging off a ramming attack. Caesar said that the enemy ships "...were constructed of planks a foot in breadth, fastened by iron spikes the thickness of a man's thumb; the anchors were secured fast by iron chains instead of cables”. When the Romans were forced to board, they faced fearsome warriors used to close-quarters fighting at sea."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Fire_Raiser_Long"	"Employed against wooden gates, stockades and walls, the fire raiser is a means of setting fortifications alight with a cauldron of hot embers, sparks and flames. With an iron cauldron at the end of a long wooden beam, the fire raiser was a mobile, bellows-driven forge. Burning coals, sulphur and pitch were placed in the cauldron, which would be pushed against the defences and then fanned to create fierce, roaring flames. The bellows were connected by an iron tube inside beam to the cauldron; when pumped, the fire flared. Iron plating on the wooden beam protected it from the cauldron’s intense fire and heat; cartwheels gave some mobility. Somewhat ad-hoc in use and construction, fire raisers were used by the Thebans against the Athenians at the Siege of Delium, but the basic principles behind them were employed by many other cultures."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Massilian_Hoplites_Long"	"The oldest city in France, Marseille, started life as a colony of the Ionian city of Phocaea in around 600BC. Legend has it that Phocis married the daughter of the local Ligurian tribe of Segobringii, Nannus, and settled there, but in reality it was probably settled by Greek refugees from the Persian attack on Phocaea. Built on rocky terrain and chosen for its natural, deep harbour and easy access to the Rhone valley, Massilia became a popular trading port situated in the middle of the Mediterranean coast. Olives and grapes were introduced to Gaul for the first time and spread north. In turn, trade with the tribes of Gaul grew, resulting in some integration between the populations. The Celts exchanged animals, grain, tin, slaves and even amber for Greek luxury goods. In 125BC the Greeks turned to the Romans to protect them against the Ligurians. Rome saved Massilia and stayed to make a foothold in Gaul, although the Greeks managed to maintain autonomy. Foolishly in 49BC the city sided with Pompey against Julius Caesar in the Roman civil war. Caesar’s Legions stormed the city, ransacked the Hellenic treasures and took its fleet. Following this, Massilia suffered as Caesar moved trade to Narbonne and Arles, later losing its independence as a self-governing city."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Chosen_Sword_Long"	"The longsword was a weapon of high worth and status within the Celtic community. A warrior had to prove himself in battle many times before he was permitted to wield one. The two-handed longsword was first developed during the 8th century BC, but fell from favour before re-emerging around 450BC. It is possible that Celtic ironwork was significantly behind that of the Romans, as apparently their longswords bent very easily and had to be straightened against the ground. On the other hand, since Celtic ironworking was several centuries old, some believe that Roman accounts of this practice mistook this practise, and it was actually a ritual to 'decommission' defeated, dishonoured or damaged weapons."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Horse_Archers_Long"	"With raiding as a way of life for many tribes, mounted archery was established early in eastern culture, producing some highly effective warriors. While foot archers could carry long, powerful bows, a mounted archer was a formidable fighter thanks to his composite bow. Constructed from layers of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was a much more powerful weapon than its size alone would suggest. In the hands of an expert an arrow on target was entirely capable of piercing chainmail armour. It did, however, require strength and care to use: in particular, it had to be kept away from damp. Military campaigns were usually fought during the summer and autumn, so bows were used during arid months. Archers could rest their weapons during the winter, taking good care of them before the next campaigning season."	"True"

Although the Romans had followed the ancient Trojan and Greek military traditions closely up to this point, they eventually eschewed phalanx combat and instead adapted their fighting style and equipment to suit the terrain upon which they fought and the particular threats they faced. Each Roman hoplite was armed with a round shield, sword, lance, crested helmet and greaves, enabling them to fight effectively in a number of different tactical situations."	"True"

They took, and changed, sides in the Punic Wars to suit their own agendas, only emerging as a single state after the cataclysmic Battle of Zama in 202BC. The defeat of Carthage allowed the Numidians to expand their lands, eventually leading to the Jugurthine War of 112-105BC against Rome. Numidia’s king, Jugurtha, was only defeated when he was betrayed by his father-in-law, Bocchus. While the Numidians were famed as cavalrymen, their infantry forces were also quite effective.

As their empire expanded, the Seleucids tried to fold many nearby territories into it, looking to put a hand on the lucrative trade routes of southern Arabia as well. In the numerous military engagements between the two states, the Nabataeans developed the need to copy the greater disciplined, better structured Hellenistic way of fighting. They also used captured gear and although they were bitter rivals, admired the Greeks for their culture and civilisation. Most famous of these encounters are the Antigonid–Nabataean confrontations in 312BC. In the first instance, Antigonus appointed one of his officers, Athenaeus to pillage Petra. He did so successfully, as the defenders were away trading during the night of the raid. Not only was their stock captured, but also families, to be traded as slaves. However, the Nabataeans quickly realised the situation and were able to hunt down the 4,600-strong army and almost wipe it out, with only a few dozen escaping. Athenaeus was not among the survivors."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Egy_Karian_Axemen_Long"	"These Greek soldiers from Karia in western Anatolia were known for their use of deadly one-handed, single-headed axes. Axes had long been used throughout Egyptian and Greek culture, from the slashing, pole-mounted examples of the former to the double-edged labrys, associated with Labraunda and held sacred by the Karian people. Acting as shock troops in Ptolemaic armies, the Karians used their axes to hack their way through armour. Even heavy or chain armour was no defence, as the concussive force of a weighted axe head could still crush bones and organs even if it failed to penetrate. Although effective, fighting in this way was both tiring and clumsy, and the initial benefit from a charge would soon wear off. Lightly armoured, with little more than shields and helmets, Karian axemen were best employed attacking the flanks of more heavily armoured foes."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Bri_Painted_Ones_Long"	"The painted warriors of Britain were recognisable thanks to the blue designs adorning their skin and made famous by Julius Caesar’s 'De Bello Gallico'. Their bravery and savagery is evident from his commentaries. Fighting unarmoured, and sometimes naked in the style of the Gaulish Gaesatae or the northern Picts, the painted ones relied on their skills with the Celtic longsword, a weapon designed to slash and hack rather than stab, and their tall shields, which could also be used as a weapon in its own right. Their tattoos generally took the form of curlicue lines, dashes and circles, which mirrored abstracted animal and natural forms. Frightening to behold, these designs probably held religious significance, uniting the warriors with their gods, their lands and their tribes. Whether woad was the source of the blue dye or some mixture of copper and iron that Caesar referred to as 'vitrum' is not entirely clear.

The cavalry of each Legion originally included 300 Equites and 600-900 Socii, giving a typical consular army of two Legions around 1,800-2,400 cavalry. During the Samnite, Pyrrhic, Punic and Jugurthine Wars, and with the demands of a growing empire, there was a gradual move away to using allied cavalry. As the equites became legionary officers and then the Socii became citizens, cavalry recruits from Italy became scarce: by the time of Caesar’s Gallic campaigns the Legions relied almost exclusively on allied cavalry. Equipment changed little during this period. The spear and chainmail adopted by the equites, probably influenced by the Celts, came full-circle with the recruitment of later Gallic cavalry. Helmet and shield styles did change and the small round shield of the equites became the versatile thureos."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ara_Camel_Archers_Long"	"Camels have a number of advantages over horses: although notorious for their questionable temperament, they can be docile when handled correctly and are less nervous than horses. As desert creatures, camels also have greater stamina and can endure long periods without water. This advantage offered a certain strategic flexibility to commanders, as long treks in arid conditions could then be undertaken. When faced by conventional cavalry, the size and odour of camels caused horses to rear-up and back away in a fight. The invention of the north Arabian saddle in the 4th century BC made effective control considerably easier; the steady, elevated position of the saddle enabled an archer to scan the battlefield and pick his targets off with some ease."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Sword_Long"	"The Iberians were a warlike collection of tribes and peoples, and this ensured their independence from both Carthage and Rome for many years. They supplied mercenaries to both sides, and were widely respected for their tactical skills and courage. Their use of the deadly falcata sword added to their reputation too. The Romans called the distinctive Iberian sword type the 'machaera Hispana' but these are now referred to as the 'falcata'. These were extremely sharp, slashing, single-edged weapons with curved back edges. The term single-edged is also slightly misleading, as the point was sharpened on the back edge as well as the front. The balance of the blade was towards the broad tip, making a blow from one of these extremely powerful. In the hands of a master, a falcata could easily dismember an opponent. The skills of Iberian metal workers added to the blade’s deadliness; their steel was generally of very high quality."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ita_Sword_Long"	"Before Rome controlled the whole of Italy it shared the peninsula with others, such as the Etruscans and Samnites. These various petty kingdoms, cities and tribes often fought each other, but also united against common external threats. It was as the Etruscans waned and Greek influence fell away that the Romans began steadily accumulating land and power. After three wars against the Samnites, Rome finally became the dominant power in Italy, and extracted pledges of loyalty and military aid from the 'Socii Latini', its Latin allies. There were further rebellions against Rome’s dominance, the most significant being the Allied War of 90-88BC, when many of the Socii turned on Rome. Clearly, this gave the Romans pause, as the peace settlement after was surprisingly generous: it gave the Socii the right of full Roman citizenship, giving them a stake in Rome's continued survival and effectively uniting the whole of Italy under their rule."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Pontic_Sword_Long"	"Employing Celtic shortswords or the xiphos, with its very similar blade-shape, these heavily-armoured elite swordsmen acted as frontline and shock infantry in Pontic armies. Garbed in scale armour and carrying thureos shields, they were equipped with javelins in addition to their swords. When charging or receiving a charge, they would throw their javelins at close range, draw their swords and attack before their enemy had chance to recover. This has led to them being referred to as imitation legionaries and the suggestion that they copied the fighting style of the Roman Legions. Over the course of the three Mithridatic Wars, waged between Pontus and Rome from 88-63BC, there was certainly time to recruit and reorganise the Pontic army on the Roman model. However, such infantry may equally have developed under the influence of the Celtic Galatian settlers or the Hellenic thorakitai, a more heavily armoured form of thureophoroi. Whatever the case, Pontic swordsmen were well disciplined and equipped, and highly effective in battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_kush_kushite_slave_infantry"	"Slavery was widespread in the ancient world. References can be traced back to the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi. The ambitious construction projects of the day, as well as the custom of enslaving war captives, were some of the reasons for the large slave population many states kept at the time. The Greek city-states, for instance, depended heavily on slave labour. Having had all their rights confiscated, slaves were considered the property of their owners and could be sold as such. In Egypt, slaves who worked within the royal households could be executed and laid next to their mummified masters in the burial chamber, to serve them in the afterlife. Slaves were widely-used by the Romans as well. As the Roman Empire expanded, slaves from all over the known world poured into the Apennine Peninsula. The more educated ones became tutors, some were sold into prostitution and some became trained gladiators. Spartacus, one such gladiator of Thracian descent, famously led a bloody revolt in 73BC, threatening Rome itself at one point, before being killed in battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_roman_three"	"Of all the warships found in the ancient world, it is the trireme, or trieres, that remains the most famous and recognisable. Nearly all Hollywood 'sword and sandal' movies will include a trireme somewhere. The vessel was entirely designed for war. Its name came from the three rows of oars carried on each side, stacked above each other in staggered columns to give the rowers some room to work. The top row of oars pivoted on a rowlock, or oarlock, mounted on an outrigger projecting from the hull. This allowed the top oars to pitch down at a sharper angle to reach the sea without getting tangled in the lower ones. The trireme was a greyhound of a ship, capable of high-speed dashes with a well-trained crew and, contrary to popular belief, not all rowers were slaves. Aboard Greek vessels they were citizens, and were given respect, not the lash. They were also largely fair-weather ships, and unsuited to rough seas such as the Atlantic; the lowest level of oars were, at most, less than half a metre above the waterline. That, however, did not stop the trireme being a superb weapon against other ships: a high-speed ramming attack could rip a hole in the side of almost any target. The type was also large enough to be used in other ways, which lead to it carrying archers and assorted light artillery pieces."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_camillus_reforms"	"Whilst Rome was a single city, its early Republican army consisted of eighteen centuries of equites, eighty-two centuries of first-class hoplites, twenty centuries each of second, third and fourth class hoplites, and thirty-two centuries of fifth class, two of which were trumpeters. These forces were insufficient to face Rome's immediate enemies - war with Hernici, Volsci, other Latin tribes and the Etruscan cities all took a toll on its warriors, their greatest defeat coming with the invasion of Brennus' Gallic hordes, who defeated the Romans at the River Allia and later sacked the city itself. Under such pressure, Rome would have been lost were it not for the intervention of Marcus Furius Camillus, who drove away the Gauls and reorganised the city's armies to better withstand future attacks. Unlike Greece, Italy didn't consist of city-states, where forces met on large plains, so battles were more often fought on difficult terrain, such as the hills to the east or the marshlands to the south. As a result, Roman infantry adopted looser formations and began to carry javelins for throwing prior to melee, meaning the Romans became more like their Gallic adversaries than the Greek Hoplites on which they were originally modelled."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_ara_desert_chariots"	"Whether drawn by two or four horses, chariots were built for speed and manoeuvrability, rather than impact and protection. They consisted of little more than yoke and a platform with axle and wheels at the back and a waist-high screen. The driver and passengers wore cloth armour and used javelins, or in some cases bows. The emphasis on speed probably comes from the role chariots played in hunting being transferred to the battlefield, especially when raiding for slaves. Despite their weight, when many chariots were drawn up together their impact against light or untrained infantry and cavalry could still be devastating!"	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_rom_roman_fleet"	"The exact origins of the Roman fleet are obscure. A traditionally agricultural and land-based society, the Romans rarely ventured out to sea unless they had to, unlike their Etruscan neighbours, until the onset of the First Punic War against Carthage. However, there is evidence of Roman warships as early as the first part of the 4th century BC, such as the one which carried an embassy to Delphi in 394BC. A ship’s crew, regardless of its size, was organised into centuries in the same way as Rome's land-based armies. Likewise, it was headed by a centurion, with an optio as his deputy, whilst a 'beneficiarius' supervised the administrative staff. Among them were also junior officers – 'principales' and other specialists exempt from certain duties, known as 'immunes'. Each ship was commanded by a 'trierarchus', although it is unclear whether he or the centurion had overall command. Naval officers were restricted to careers in the fleet until the 3rd century BC, when their pay and benefits were advanced to the status of legionary officers. From this point onwards, it was even possible to transfer from the navy to the army and back again, should the opportunity or need arise."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Silver_Shield_Pike_Long"	"During his final years on campaign, Alexander the Great renamed his elite hypaspist infantrymen argyraspides or 'Silver Shields'. Following Alexander’s untimely death, his generals fought each other for territory and the enormous power that came with it. When the smoke cleared, the former 'commander-in-chief of the camp', Seleucus, controlled Babylon and several other eastern satrapies, proclaiming himself king in 306BC. His territory became known as the Seleucid Empire, and the Silver Shields formed the elite of its armies from the very beginning. Throughout most of their tenure they were equipped in the Macedonian fashion and trained for phalanx combat like their illustrious forebears. However, following their catastrophic defeat at Magnesia in 190BC by the Romans, the Seleucids began to re-model the Silver Shields on the impressive Roman legionaries who defeated them, certainly in equipment if not in tactics. It is thought that the 5000 men at the head of the Daphne Parade in 166BC were Silver Shields equipped in this way."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Citizen_Cav_Long"	"The early Greek cavalry took roughly the same form throughout the city-states, being comprised of citizens able to afford and maintain a horse. After the Greco-Persian Wars, city-states such as Athens founded more permanent cavalry funded by annual grants. Right through the Peloponnesian War however, this volunteer cavalry continued to be few in numbers, and was used principally to chase skirmishers and fleeing hoplites. It was not that cavalry were ineffectual in Greek warfare, as shown by the Theban victory at the Battle of Delium in 424BC, but until this time they had been underused and lacked the numbers to make a decisive impact. Often wearing a metal helm and a mailed cuirass reaching down to their knees, they were equipped with a long sword and a spear, usable as both a lance and a javelin. However, a lack of saddle and stirrups, unused by the Greeks of the time, made them relatively easy to knock from horseback."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_nab_heavy_desert_spearmen"	"Spearmen were drawn from among Nabataean subjects from the eastern regions. They were inexpensive, and simply equipped with a spear, wicker shield and cloth armour. Their shields were oval or rectangular in shape with a central handgrip. While uniformly equipped for the most part, their appearance varied greatly depending on where they were recruited, and all kinds of Greek and Persian influences were manifest. In battle, spearmen guarded the flanks of phalanxes, or provided protection for skirmishers and archers. Although ill-equipped to face heavy enemies, their numbers and spears made them an effective counter to unarmoured cavalry. Spearmen were also a common type of mercenary and levied unit throughout Asia Minor and the Middle East."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Companion_Cav_Long"	"Macedonian Companion cavalry, known in Greek as the hetairoi, were the foremost shock troops of their age. Originally formed from the Macedonian nobility, esteemed friends and companions of their kings, these elite horsemen evolved under Philip II and Alexander the Great into a highly disciplined and formidable force with the adoption of the wedge formation that increased not only their manoeuvrability, but also their impact. Eventually their numbers were extended to include not just nobles, but in fact anyone who had been a friend to the king. Early Greek cavalry had been limited to skirmishing scouts and archers, as square formations of heavy cavalry up until this point were difficult to direct and wheel. However, the adoption of the wedge formation enabled the companions to exploit weak points or break the flanks of enemy infantry with precision. To achieve this they were armed with the 'xyston', a fearsome double-ended lance, designed to counter-balance itself and be reversible should one end break, plus a straight sword or curved kopis for close-quarters fighting. Armour took the form of a shaped bronze corselet, with optional greaves, and an open Boeotian helmet, which afforded some protection without hampering vision. The horse itself was unarmoured. The rider sat on a blanket, as neither saddle nor stirrups were used at this time."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Axe_Warriors_Long"	"Celtic warriors were ideally equipped to hack through even heavily-armoured foes. Their axes took one of two forms: one-handed axes were typical, and the most practical, but two-handed axes were also used. In comparison to swords, axes were cheap to make, and were effective against chainmail, as a blow could still shatter bone and crush the organs beneath the armour. They could also be used to pull aside shields, or hack them apart. Like other Celtic warriors, the lightly-armoured, one-handed axemen relied on their own shields for defence. There was a long tradition, perhaps dating as far back as the Stone Age, of veneration for axes and hammers in Celtic cultures. Although both were associated with strength, axes in particular were used as grave goods and even depicted on coins celebrating victories in the Gallic Wars of 58-50BC."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Lusitani_Swordwomen_Long"	"The Lusitani were renowned for their skill in guerrilla warfare and bravery in battle. Both men and women took part in a type of tribal dancing which helped to strengthen their legs. This was undoubtedly a contributing factor to the nimbleness and agility displayed by their warriors. During the ‘Fiery War’ between the Lusitanian chief, Viriathus, and Rome the ferocity of the women of Lusitania was recorded by the Roman Sextus Junius Brutus. During the Roman pursuit of the rebel leader he observed that women were often found defending their settlements: “fighting and perishing in company with the men with such bravery that they uttered no cry even in the midst of slaughter”."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_num_numidian_riders"	"Numidian tribesmen were raised with horses from an early age, riding bareback without a bridle and controlling their horses by tapping the beasts between the ears with a stick. Numidian cavalry were supremely agile, skirmishing with assured expertise before swinging around to escape as rapidly as they had arrived. Wearing only a thin tunic, they carried javelins and small wicker shields. At Cannae, the highpoint of Carthaginian military success, Hannibal’s right wing consisted of 3,500 Numidian cavalrymen. The Numidians attacked the Romans' allied cavalry and chased them from the field before returning to smash into the rear of the Roman lines. Considered the elite of the Carthaginian army during the Second Punic War, the Numidians' defection before the Battle of Zama arguably led to Scipio’s victory over Hannibal in the final stages of the conflict."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Night_Hunters_Long"	"The Germanic Harii tribe were a warrior cult, shrouded in mystery. Their night hunters were a terrifying prospect if met on the battlefield. Their bodies, shields and weapons were painted black for maximum shock value. The Roman historian, Tacitus, said this of the Harii: “…quite apart from their strength, which exceeds that of the other tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black shields and painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so unexpected and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered”."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_greek_seven"	"An arms race in warship size developed between the various nations around the Mediterranean. Size, in terms of the number of rowers, ships length and bulk and above all majesty of the vessel became as much a tool of statecraft as of warfare. A people who could afford such ships were almost certainly rich enough to withstand the strains of any war. A 'four' or quadreme was still a handy warship, able to manoeuvre in battle. The same could not be said of some of the large polyremes, a word meaning many oars. Practical archaeology shows that too many banks of oars simply don't work, so polyreme probably referred to the number of rowers: an octeres is likely to have had some eight rowers per bank of three oars, arranged in three, three, and two to an oar going up from the waterline. King Demetius of Macedon led his fleet at the battle of Salamis in 306BC from the deck of a hepteres or 'seven', but his ambitions didn't stop there. Neither did those of other kingdoms, and later lumbering warships including 'elevens', 'thirteens' and larger. As bigger ships to carry more rowers such vessels could also carry big marine contingents, arrow towers and an array of useful artillery."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Cal_Caledonian_Oathsworn"	"When a young Celtic warrior wanted to prove himself and attain glory, it was common practice to join a veteran's retinue and fight alongside him. Such was the hierarchy of the warband - the stronger the warrior, the more men looked to him in battle. With every encounter, the men developed loyalty towards each other as brothers in arms. As a final rite of passage to elite warrior status, the bravest fighters swore an oath to their chieftain - to always be loyal, to fight together and to die before letting harm come to their leader. This relationship was a sacred bond - no 'Oathsworn' would leave the battlefield before his chief had retired, and abandoning the body of a dead chief was irredeemably shameful. In return for this loyalty, the chief treated these men with the highest regard and honoured them with gifts."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Aux_Socii_Hastati_Long"	"Although the early Socii troops varied greatly in armament and style, between the times of the Camillan and Polybian military reforms most Socii infantry adopted the equipment of the Roman hastati. Each carried a gladius and two pila, and either the hastati’s scutum or shields inspired by their Etruscan, Samnite or Greek ancestry. Usually wearing bronze helmets and breastplates, Socii were drawn from the city-states and tribes of the Italian peninsula, and were expected to provide half the troops of a Roman army. In battle, they would normally be split into two forces under the command of a praefectus, and take position on a Legions' flank. During the Allied Wars of 90-88BC the Socii revolted against Rome; not for independence, but to gain the full rights of Roman citizenship. In an attempt to resolve the conflict, those that did not rebel were rewarded with citizenship, although eventually the entire Italian population became citizens."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Bithynian_Infantry_Long"	"These fierce warriors hailed from northwest Asia Minor and, as their lands changed hands between Greek and Persian rulers, they were subject to many influences. In battle they used the crescent-shaped 'pelte' shields of the Thracians, but eastern axes instead of forward-curving swords or 'rhomphaia'. This made them deadly against heavily-armoured foes as their axes could crush organs and break bones without necessarily penetrating armour. The Bithynians wore light armour for the most part, and also carried javelins, much like peltasts. Their style of fighting probably owed much to the mountainous and difficult terrain of Bithynia, as they were, in part, skirmishers and also similar to the thorakitai, or heavier warriors."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Sax_Saxon_Raiders"	"Arguably the first time the 'Saxoni' - an aggressive Germanic tribe - was mentioned was by the Egyptian writer Claudius Ptolemy in 'Geographia', during the 2nd century AD. At the time, they were thought to occupy land to the north of the Lower Elbe river, where modern-day Hamburg stands today. The Emperor Julian mentioned the Saxoni again, in AD 356, during a speech against his rival, Magnentius, with whom they had allied. In the 3rd century AD, pressure on the Roman Empire's northern frontier, due to alarmingly-frequent Saxoni raids, led to dedicated defence of the 'Saxon Shore' on both sides of the English Channel. Several branches of Saxoni, along with their neighbours the Angles and Jutes, migrated and settle in the former Roman province of Britannia, eventually becoming known as the 'English'."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Ste_Steppe_Horse_Archers"	"The skill required to fire a bow from a moving horse is phenomenal. Ancient cavalry archers had to keep control of their mounts with their knees whilst using both arms to fire their bows, which took a great deal of practice and physical strength. Often lightly armoured, horse archers were the ideal skirmish troops, as they could quickly reach key areas of the battlefield to harass the enemy, but without getting so close that they were forced into melee. Nomadic tribes, such as the Sarmatians, were renowned for their skilled riders and used horse archers to great effect. The combination of skill and the deadly composite bow, which could puncture straight through armour, made their horsemen the dread of all those they encountered."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Aux_Pontic_Cavalry"	"Like the Companion Cavalry of old Macedon, elite horsemen from the lands of Parthia and Pontus were recruited from among the nobility and social elite. Gradually, they developed into a permanent and professional force of bodyguards, and following both the Hellenic and Persian traditions, were armed with lances and armoured in the traditional fashion. Their mounts, however, were more heavily armoured in the eastern style. This gave their charges extra weight and meant that they were not only a counter to other cavalry forces, but could also be sent into the flanks of densely-packed infantry. The eastern influence also meant that Pontic nobles were quite at home with bows, as they had spent much of their early lives learning to hunt from horseback - a skill that could easily be adapted to bring down human targets."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Cav_Long"	"The Iberians harboured a great deal of respect for horses, even worshipping them as divine creatures. In times of war the horse had previously played a minor role, but gradually progressed from a symbol of prestige, and noble warrior’s ride to the battlefield, to becoming a major presence in the battle itself. Blessed with horses of great quality, Iberian cavalry grew to become one of the most potent weapons of the ancient world. Their horses were as fast and as nimble as the renowned Numidian steeds and, having been trained to cope with the rough terrain of the Iberian peninsula, were hardy beasts also. The combination of fine mounts and dextrous riders enabled Iberian cavalry to establish themselves as mercenaries sought after by both Carthage and Rome."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Scut_Spear_Long"	"Scutarii, or shield bearers, take their name from the Latin word scutum, or shield, although it is highly unlikely the Iberians used this title for themselves. Regardless, the scutarii carried the thureos, a large, oval, wooden shield that was perfectly suited for use in man-to-man combat. They wore little armour, and this gave them greater mobility than many of their opponents, particularly the armoured Roman legionaries. This mobility was used to charge forward and then feign retreat in the hope of getting the enemy to pursue and break their lines. Once an enemy unit took the bait, the retreat would end, and a genuine attack on now-out-of-position and unsupported foes would be staged: a simple tactic, perhaps, but still a deadly one when used well."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Ptolemaic_Cav_Long"	"Following the tradition of elite Hellenic shock cavalry, these horsemen employed heavy armour and fearsome xyston or kontos-like lances. These were considerably longer than normal cavalry spears and balanced by a butt-spike. Using such weapons required Ptolemaic cavalry to forgo shields and steer their mounts with their legs in the same fashion as Saka and Sarmatian archers, and later cataphracts. Unlike their eastern counterparts, Ptolemaic cavalry did not armour their horses in scale until around the 1st century BC. They were heavily armoured themselves, initially wearing bronze cuirasses and helmets but later scale or chainmail armour. Recruited almost exclusively from the richest Greek colonists in Egypt, their numbers were never great but they provided a vital shock element alongside lighter Egyptian and mercenary cavalry."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Eas_Camel_Spearmen"	"Camels, both dromedaries and Bactrians, were used by the eastern empires of the ancient world. Their pungent natural odour disorientated and frightened horses, and made sure they were valued as light shock cavalry. Over time, their use spread west across northern Africa and reputedly there was even a detachment in Emperor Claudius’ army during the conquest of far-off Britannia. Like other light cavalry, they carried spears and sometimes javelins to harass and chase off enemy light cavalry, infantry and skirmishers. Their real strength came from the quality of their camels, which allowed them to patrol arid areas easily. Romans introduced camels in a select few of their North African military units under Hadrian in the 2nd century AD."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Pal_Palmyrene_Cataphracts"	"As you might expect due to its geographical origins, eastern cavalry had both Hellenic and Persian influences, with the more eastern states favouring the cataphract, where all-over heavy armour was used to protect both the rider and horse. The cataphract has its origins early in antiquity, in what is now Iran. Cataphract cavalry was designed to be a hammer in the tactical toolbox of eastern generals, penetrating enemy formations before outflanking and exploiting the resultant chaos. This was helped by the use of the wedge formation to smash through enemy lines. The Sassanids famously fielded the 'Zhayedan', a force of 10,000 strong cataphract riders, as shock troops to quickly and effectively decimate their opponents."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_samnites"	"The Samnites were a confederation of four ancient Italic tribes: the Hirpini, Caudini, Caraceni and Pentri, who resided in Samnium, in south-central Italy, but are thought to have Sabine roots in the Apennine mountains. The Samnites were a hardy, warlike people, adept at fighting on Italy's uneven hillside terrain. Their manipular formations, in contrast to the phalanx-style combat prevalent across the peninsula, were much better suited to engagements in difficult territory and were the main reason for the Samnites' expansion into Campania. Samnite warriors were as honourable as they were fierce - the notion of slavery was alien to them and they instead chose to live as a society of free men. During the 5th century BC, the Samnites expanded into southern Italy, capturing the Etruscan cities of Capua and Cumae and establishing themselves in Campania. Their way of life made for strong alliances with the mounted nobles of Campania, the Lucanian warriors to the south, and other warlike tribes residing in Samnite lands."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Afr_Levy_Spear_Long"	"Throughout the civilised world, levies formed the backbone of many armies. Called to service from among citizens or subjects, they followed a long tradition that began, in Greece at least, with hoplite warfare between the city-states. Equipped with spears, these levied phalanxes could present a formidable wall of spear points to other infantry and cavalry. What levies lacked in skill and discipline compared to professional soldiers and mercenaries, they made up for in numbers and the advantage their weaponry provided. These troops, especially the citizen-levy of the Greek city-states, were at first expected to provide their own arms and equipment. As time passed, the citizen army developed into a more formalised body in which arms and equipment were provided. Often, however, personal loyalty to a general or king replaced any sense of civic duty, although 'civic duty' might be grudging to say the least in men taken from their homes, families and livelihoods, and thrust into battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_messapian_warriors"	"Like the Siculi tribe to the west in Sicily, Messapian warriors favoured large shields and open-faced, Illyrian style helmets, albeit with more crests and, on occasion, horns. Their weapon of choice was the spear; some Iapygian tribes, like their Illyrian ancestors, adopted the Greek style of hoplite phalanx combat, whilst others fought in a less organised style, using shorter, multi-purpose spears. Short melee weapons were also used, such as the curved 'kopis' swords and one-handed axes. Messapian warfare was a mixture of their Illyrian heritage and the influence of their Oscan neighbours. The former employed skirmishers, who were useful for raiding and piracy, while the latter wasn't able to field javelinmen and slingers in any numbers, instead relying on mounted nobles supported by their retainers. According to Herodotus, Oscan tribal cavalry was crucial in holding off Taras' invasion of Messapian and Peucetian towns in 473BC, an action which extended the conflict until 467BC. The king of Messapia later made two alliances with Athens, around 430BC and again in 418 BC, supplying the Athenians with javelinmen for the war against Syracuse."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_ara_desert_heavy_lancers"	"The Arabian Peninsula was not a state, but a land occupied by inter-related tribes and powerful families. The nomadic Bedouin raised sheep and traded goods across the desert, while farmers were settled around the oases. The camel helped the nomadic tribes to grow in power, and the variety among the tribes produced many different fighting styles, but infantry nevertheless remained important in Arab armies. Although unarmoured slingers were fast and effective skirmishers, and Arabs also prided themselves on their close-combat skills. Traditionally, they fought as raiders looking for loot rather than conquest. Raids or 'razzias' brought honour to the victors, as well as the spoils of livestock and goods for their tribes. Conflicts were usually small in scale and casualties were largely avoided, as a fighting retreat in the face of great odds was not considered shameful. After the conquest of Egypt, Rome had to cross the Arabian Peninsula in order to secure the lucrative trade with India, but the Romans never fully conquered the desert or the desert peoples."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_saba_royal_marib_cavalry"	"The city of Marib was not only the seat of the kings of Saba, it was an important economical and agricultural centre, as well as a place of worship. Its temple complex had multi-storey buildings and was situated directly on top of the trade routes to India, in the heart of Arabia Felix. However, it's most prominent feature was the Great Marib Dam, built around the 8th century BC, although smaller dams and canals were constructed in the region for centuries. The dam's elaborate irrigation system allowed the Sabaeans to prosper through the trade of frankincense and myrrh, which they cultivated. This strong geographical position also helped them maintain their wealth and political power. Unfortunately, as the trade routes shifted north, the Sabaeans fell out of favour and their glorious civilisation declined around the 1st century AD."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_kush_kushite_pikes"	"From their position on the Nile, the Kushite Nubians profoundly influenced the world around them. They have an impressive history from their tribal beginnings, through their time as part of the New Kingdom of Egypt to the rise of their own empire, when the kingdom – or Kush – extended across large tracts of southern Egypt. They repelled multiple Roman advances, and even survived the sacking of their capital during the 1st century BC. Though their kingdom declined in late antiquity, the Kushites remained a geopolitical and military force to be reckoned with and were never absorbed into the Roman Empire. They were famed for their formidable archers, with man and bow working as one."	"True"

The ambitious construction projects of the day, as well as the custom of enslaving war captives, were some of the reasons for the large slave population many states kept at the time. The Greek city-states, for instance, depended heavily on slave labour. Having had all their rights confiscated, slaves were considered the property of their owners and could be sold as such. In Egypt, slaves who worked within the royal households could be executed and laid next to their mummified masters in the burial chamber, to serve them in the afterlife. Slaves were widely-used by the Romans as well. As the Roman Empire expanded, slaves from all over the known world poured into the Apennine Peninsula.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Scorpion_Pot_Ballista_Long"	"A ballista could be aimed effectively, but that accuracy came at a cost in range; it could fire no more than a distance of around 500 metres. Using a pair of torsion springs with levers inserted into twisted ropes made from animal sinew, the ballista was incredibly powerful for a machine of its size. Generally firing solid shot or bolts, it could also be modified to throw clay pots filled with snakes or scorpions. Equally effective against infantry or cavalry, it could also be deployed to destroy light fortifications during sieges. Originally developed by the Greeks around 400BC, and based on the oversized Oxybeles composite bow, ballistae were widely used by many cultures of the period, including the Romans. Later Roman versions included adjustable caps that enabled crews to quickly alter the tension of each sinew bundle to provide balance and therefore improve accuracy."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Egy_Nubian_Bowmen_Long"	"Nubian archers from the ‘Land of the Bow’ were famed for their skills and used as mercenaries by the Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt after the death of Alexander. Archery was valued in Nubian society: their gods and rulers were often depicted with bows or archers’ thumb rings, and their warriors were often buried with bows, quivers, arrows and rings. The shaped metal rings guarded archers’ fingers, allowing them to fully draw their powerful bows. Several types of bow were employed, including the longbow and composite bow. There were also many types of arrowhead, some of which were barbed to make them more difficult to remove from a wound. As unarmoured skirmishers, Nubian archers relied on their spear-armed comrades to keep the enemy at bay whilst they made their shots count. Under the Kushite queen, Amanirenas, Nubian archers defeated a Roman force and, after five years of war, a peace that favoured the Kushites was agreed in 20BC."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Gal_Spear_Warriors"	"While Celts often lacked the formal organisations and tactics of their more 'civilised' opponents, they did have extremely able metalworkers, and long experience as mercenaries. In battle, they were not outmatched on an individual level by civilised soldiers. Celts often favoured the spear in battle; it is a simple weapon, and a typical Celtic warrior might carry several into a fight - lighter javelins to hurl at the enemy on the approach or charge, and sometimes an iron-tipped spear for close combat. Some spears were crafted with barbed tips to cause further damage as they were pulled from wounds. Spears were also convenient for displaying trophies, in the shape of rotting enemy heads, an intimidating sight for all but the hardest of foes. This bloody appearance by the Celts, and a ferocious appetite for battle, was often enough to un-man opponents. Celtic warriors would send a chorus of chants, taunts and insults aimed towards foes, and blow their unearthly-sounding 'carnyx' battle horns. The whole display was intended to frighten foes, and put the warriors into the right frame of mind for battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_afr_desert_chariots"	"Perhaps influenced by earlier Egyptian and Hittite examples, some kingdoms in Saharan Africa adopted the chariot by the 5th century BC. Usage was most prevalent amongst the Garamantians, and Herodotus recorded them raiding their southern Ethiopian neighbours using four-horse chariots. Whether drawn by two or four horses, chariots were built for speed and manoeuvrability, rather than impact and protection. They consisted of little more than yoke and a platform with axle and wheels at the back and a waist-high screen. The driver and passengers wore cloth armour and used javelins, or in some cases bows. The emphasis on speed probably comes from the role chariots played in hunting being transferred to the battlefield, especially when raiding for slaves. Despite their weight, when many chariots were drawn up together their impact against light or untrained infantry and cavalry could still be devastating!"	"True"

Celtic tribesmen, the Galatians migrated south into central Anatolia and eastern Phrygia following Brennus’ invasions of Macedon and Greece in 279BC. They had a fierce reputation and found employment as mercenaries throughout the Hellenistic world. Held in high esteem throughout the period, they fought in the Celtic style, making use of swords, javelins and oval shields. Auxiliaries in the Egyptian army were not generally armoured, but the Galatians of the royal guard wore mail shirts by the time of the last Cleopatra; she was given 300 Galatian warriors in 48BC by Julius Caesar. Galatians were a practical solution to a manpower shortage faced by the Ptolemaic dynasty; the loyalty of mercenaries could easily be purchased with Egypt’s wealth, and they were far less likely to turn on their foreign masters than the Egyptians."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Pal_Palmyrene_Skirmishers"	"The javelin is among the oldest weapons - the idea of using a sharp stick to bring down large predators goes right back to the Stone Age, and endured throughout antiquity. Equipped with javelins and little else, skirmishers harried their opposite numbers and peppered hoplite phalanxes before quickly retreating. This was the typical tactic of all unarmoured, javelin troops: to engage at range and then fall back behind more heavily-armoured infantry, or continue attacks while trying to stay just out of the enemy's reach. Such harassment could be highly effective; if enemy forces lacked the support of skirmishers or cavalry they were severely punished by javelin-armed skirmishers who refused to meet them at close-quarters. Over time, shields became common also, such as those used by Thracian and Greek peltasts, but these were rendered obsolete by the heavier Hellenic thureophoroi. Nevertheless, javelinmen and other irregulars continued to play a part in many armies throughout antiquity."	"True"

Kept and maintained at the king’s expense, royal guards were both highly drilled and disciplined. This close association with the king extended to their dwelling place, such units being garrisoned in or near the king’s palace or sleeping in the palace courtyards. Inspired by the elite units of Alexander, such as the hypaspists and Silver Shields, the concept of elite foot guards may have originated with the squires and armour bearers of the Companion cavalry."

Founded in 706BC as Taras, it began as the home of the Partheniae, Spartans exiled due to their impure bloodlines. Fortunately, the colony was able to breed superb warhorses, and so its warriors duly grew in reputation. Tarantine cavalry could be combined well with a slow-moving phalanx, providing a rapid and flexible defensive screen for the hoplites’ exposed flanks. Their suitability for such a role, in addition to a growing need for mercenaries in the armies of the Hellenistic world, saw that the Tarantines were much sought after. By the 3rd century BC there was some evidence to suggest that they no longer came exclusively from Taranto itself, the word 'Tarantine' referring more to the unit’s tactics and weaponry rather than its geographic origins."

Whereas the Romans didn’t traditionally use archers, once they conquered Greece Cretan archers began to appear as auxiliary troops in their armies.

In addition, they wore little or no armour and carried three javelins. After harassing the enemy, peltasts would hastily retreat before any counter-charge or flanking move could be carried out. As armies developed and tactics became more complex, peltasts were expected to fight hand-to-hand too, being given stiffened-linen cuirasses and short swords with which to defend themselves in melee. They were still expected to use javelins, but could then join in the close-quarters fighting. Eventually, as infantry got heavier during the iron age, peltasts even exchanged their characteristic shield for the heavier thureos, although their name and battlefield function remained unchanged."

As their empire expanded, the Seleucids tried to fold many nearby territories into it, looking to put a hand on the lucrative trade routes of southern Arabia as well. In the numerous military engagements between the two states, the Nabataeans developed the need to copy the greater disciplined, better structured Hellenistic way of fighting. They also used captured gear and although they were bitter rivals, admired the Greeks for their culture and civilisation. Most famous of these encounters are the Antigonid–Nabataean confrontations in 312BC. In the first instance, Antigonus appointed one of his officers, Athenaeus to pillage Petra. He did so successfully, as the defenders were away trading during the night of the raid. Not only was their stock captured, but also families, to be traded as slaves. However, the Nabataeans quickly realised the situation and were able to hunt down the 4,600-strong army and almost wipe it out, with only a few dozen escaping. Athenaeus was not among the survivors."

Equipped with spears, small shields and cloth armour, they acted against opposing cavalry, enabling their horse riding counterparts to harry the enemy and safely retreat to cover. This was especially true of the bitter feuding and warfare between the Massylii and Masaesylis themselves, which saw them taking and changing sides throughout the Punic Wars, until a united Numidia emerged following the Battle of Zama in 202BC. With the fall of Carthage, Numidia was free to expand, and this ultimately led to the Jugurthine War of 112–105BC, between Numidia’s king, Jugurtha, and Rome, which was only concluded when Jugurtha was betrayed by his father-in-law, Bocchus."

In the years immediately prior the Legions had taken some heavy losses from the superior horse units of the eastern empires. This reorganisation was almost certainly an attempt to curb Roman losses and enable them to compete with the enemy's burgeoning cavalry tactics.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Aux_Libyan_Generic"	"Under the rule of Augustus, the Romans completed their conquest of northern Africa. As part of Africa Nova province, the Libyan Tripolitania region was prosperous and reached a golden age during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. Its greatest city, Leptis Magna, grew rapidly under Roman administration and achieved its greatest prominence in 193 AD as home to Emperor Septimius Severus. As the Imperial family's foremost residence, the strongest Libyan warriors were recruited into its personal guard and later used as auxiliary units elsewhere in the Empire. The local Berber tribes consisted of tough desert fighters with a strong military tradition, having famously fought on both sides during the cataclysmic Punic Wars. During the 3rd century AD, the Roman Empire fell into its greatest crisis yet, and with it trade deteriorated precipitously. This led to Leptis Magna's decline in importance - the region was mostly abandoned, as its soldiers were stationed on European fronts, fighting alongside the Roman Legions."	"True"

Typically the poorest members of a Roman Legion, leves were attached to the hastati and faced the full enemy onslaught. They were used as a screen and to skirmish with the enemy’s front line. Un able to afford much armour, the leves used javelins in support of their richer compatriots. Historically, there were 300 leves alongside 900 hastati: 20 leves in front of each of the 60 maniples.

The land-owning nobility, the Azat, were descended, so they claimed, from the Armenian gods, and like the nobles of many lands they fought as cavalry. They produced elite, heavily-armed and armoured cavalry that served as superb bodyguards. Historically, they carried lances, along with longswords, maces or axes, making them deadly in close-quarters combat. In 368AD, at the siege of Artogerassa by the Sassanids under Shapur II, they protected Pharantzem, King Arsaces II's wife.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Thr_Royal_Cav"	"Prized for their strong and swift horses, archaic Thracian cavalry mostly consisted of skirmishers. Their weapons varied from tribe to tribe, but they typically used javelins and the kopis sword, although the eastern tribes were known for their skill with the composite bow. Thracians generally rode unarmoured, apart from the crescent shaped pelte shield. Mainly, they fought while dismounted, the pelte being strapped to their backs whilst riding. What little heavy cavalry there was in Thrace took the form of the king’s bodyguard. All of this changed with the introduction of the saddle in the 4th century BC. Probably adopted either from their Scythian neighbours or the invading Celts, the saddle led to Thracian cavalry becoming more heavily armoured, with riders wearing metal helmets and corselets, and using rounded shields. Their armament also changed, with the spear and sica being more commonly employed. A forward curving Thracian sword, the sica could easily slice off a limb."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Agema_Spears_Long"	"Composed of veterans, agema - or guards - were elite units within Hellenic and Successor armies. They first appeared under Alexander the Great, where elitism was actively encouraged and rewarded, marking the move from citizen soldiers, loyal to the state, to professional armies, loyal to their general. Alexander’s agema probably developed from the ranks of his Companions, but as his campaigns continued successfully more units of veterans naturally emerged. Known as hypaspists, they probably fought in the hoplite style, but used a smaller hoplon than their predecessors. Their role was to protect the vulnerable flanks of the pike phalanxes and support the cavalry. Such units could have long careers, the famed silver shields, for instance, fought as mercenaries first for Eumenes and then Antigonus after Alexander’s death, also being used as the blueprint for the later Seleucid Silver Shields. Highly valued for their experience, many Silver Shields continued fighting well into their sixties. Later agema diversified, and the term came to be used for many elite or veteran hypaspist, peltast or cavalry units during the period. These units often bore battle honours or nicknames celebrating their victories; at the siege of Oaeneum in 169BC a vanguard of peltasts, the ‘nicatores’, or ‘conquerors’, stormed the walls."	"True"

The young warriors of the Chatti tribe were unique in this respect, growing their hair and beards until they claimed their first kill in battle. As a result, unkempt facial hair was seen as the mark of men yet to prove their worth, or cowardice. It is said, however, that the bravest Chatti grew enamoured with their lengthy beards and, even when white with age, and having claimed many kills, wore them with defiance.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Scout_Riders_Long"	"The lack of strong, fast mounts in northern Europe restricted the Germans’ ability to build cavalry forces. Horses were expensive to keep and, given the size and strength of the typical German tribesman, he was more suited to life as an infantryman. Even so, there were a number of tribes that became renowned for their expertise as horsemen; the Usipi and, in particular, the Tencteri tribes, who dwelt on the east of the river Rhine, possessed much-admired cavalrymen. The Tencteri had a strong tradition: their children were raised playing with horses, which were well-respected and treasured possessions. The horse was always inherited by the strongest, most warlike man within a family, helping to create a strong cavalry presence within the tribe. German light cavalry often attacked in a circular motion, throwing javelins before stabbing at close quarters with spears and wheeling to the right. By attacking in a circle, no single man ever led or brought up the rear and, as the attack rotated, each man in turn came into contact with the enemy."	"True"

Constructed from a combination of wood, sinew and animal horn, the composite bow was far more effective than the traditional wooden or 'self' bow. As its core offered greater flexibility, allowing the archer to draw its string back further and achieve a great range and power, the composite bow could find a target up to 35 metres away and pierce chainmail armour. Requiring great strength and stamina to use well, the composite bow demanded respect, care and attention. As military campaigns were often fought during the summer and autumn months, archers could rest their weapons during the winter - reconditioning the bodies before restringing and tensioning for future use."

Infantry was also important to Palmyra's military, since northern Arabia had many forts and castles in defensible ravines, intended to repel the raids of neighbouring tribes. Only the strongest cavalrymen were selected to be part of the royal palace guard.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Aux_Socii_Equites_Extraordinarii_Long"	"The equites extraordinarii were drawn from amongst the Socii, allied non-citizens who provided most of the early Republic's cavalry. Up to a third of allied cavalry could be selected to join the equites extraordinarii. As there were typically two or three times the number of Socii than Roman cavalry, a consular army of two Legions could have some 1,800 Socii cavalry, of which at least 600 would be considered part of the elite equites extraordinarii. By tradition, Roman cavalry was habitually deployed on the right flank, while the equites extraordinarii were sent to the left. This imbalance was famously exploited by Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae in 216BC, when the Carthaginian cavalry under Hasdrubal routed the weaker Roman cavalry while the crack Numidian light cavalry waylaid their Socii allies, such was the difference in troop quality.

They used a variety of weapons; the Parthian spear being the most famous, but also lances, swords, maces and axes.

A Consul would have several Legati with him, often his friends and family. As aristocrats, Legati would also take home a share of the spoils from any campaign. Pompey had fifteen Legati accompany him on campaign in Asia Minor. During the Imperial era, the rank 'Legatus Legionis' was given to Legion commanders selected by the Emperor, although with Senatorial approval.

Although without formal positions in tribal politics, in some societies a woman could still inherit the influence of her husband or father, and this could be used to take terrible vengeance.

It was as the Etruscans waned and Greek influence fell away that the Romans began steadily accumulating land and power. Their conquest of the Apennine Peninsula was possible due to the levied troops of every tribe absorbed into the early Roman Republic. Conflict was common in Italy - most tribes went to war during the summer months, to raid neighbouring settlements for riches and resources. Rome made the most of these warlike tribesmen, drawing soldiers from their ranks in exchange for citizenship and social status within the growing Republic. The earliest example of Rome's alliances with neighbouring states was the Foedus Cassianum, with the surrounding Latin city-states shortly after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy in 510BC. The terms were simple and effective: mutual defence for both parties, based on equal contribution to an annual military levy under Roman command."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_ara_caravan_guard"	"The Arabian Peninsula was not a state, but a land occupied by inter-related tribes and powerful families. The nomadic Bedouin raised sheep and traded goods across the desert, while farmers were settled around the oases. The camel helped the nomadic tribes to grow in power, and the variety among the tribes produced many different fighting styles, but infantry nevertheless remained important in Arab armies. Although unarmoured slingers were fast and effective skirmishers, and Arabs also prided themselves on their close-combat skills. Traditionally, they fought as raiders looking for loot rather than conquest. Raids or 'razzias' brought honour to the victors, as well as the spoils of livestock and goods for their tribes. Conflicts were usually small in scale and casualties were largely avoided, as a fighting retreat in the face of great odds was not considered shameful. After the conquest of Egypt, Rome had to cross the Arabian Peninsula in order to secure the lucrative trade with India, but the Romans never fully conquered the desert or the desert peoples."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Germanic_Hurlers"	"The young people of the Germanic tribes grew up throwing the stones found on the river beds of northern Europe, giving them a natural advantage when applying the skill to combat. Rocks and stones were in ready supply so, whilst spears may have needed repair after a battle, slingers were always well provisioned. Poor people of low status, both in society and subsequently in battle, would typically take up position behind veteran warriors, protecting them from enemy attacks. In return, the veterans would use their shields to safeguard those behind them as they unleashed their rain of missiles. Slingshot could be an effective weapon against close enemy formations or cavalry."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Gladiators_Long"	"Gladiators were usually slaves, condemned criminals or prisoners of war but others did enter the arena. Those with debts or a lust for glory could sell themselves as gladiators, and soldiers who had given ground might be sent to the arena as punishment. A gladiator's life was arduous and brutal, even before fighting in the games. Trainees could, and would, be killed in practice if they fought beneath their abilities, as a way of encouraging the others. The ludus, the training ground and home of gladiators, was run by a lanista, and within its walls his word was law. Outside the arena he was considered to be on the bottom rung of society; some Roman cemeteries did not allow the bodies of lanistas to be buried inside their walls, even. Having said that, there was also a peculiar glamour about their business and some were famed amongst games fans as the men who owned and trained gladiators - the sports stars of the Roman world."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Ger_Germanic_Pikes"	"Once use of the pike in battle had spread to the west, it was adopted by many of the barbarian tribes. As an extension of the popular 'shield wall' formation, emergent barbarian pike tactics had similarities to the phalanx combat favoured by the Hellenic states before the rise of Rome. However, tribal pike troops fought far more defensively than the Greeks, especially with the advent of heavy cavalry such as lancers and their supplanting of the more traditional barbarian infantry charge with brutal shock tactics. Gradually, pikes became a popular defensive choice all over northern Europe; the Norsemen used them in a similar, circular formation of around 1000 men in a tightly-packed mass, designed to stop enemy cavalry charges dead in their tracks. This also likely gave rise to the later ‘schiltron’ or ‘shield troop’ formation commonly used by Scottish medieval armies."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_saba_camel_lancers"	"Camels have a number of advantages over horses: although notorious for their questionable temperament, they can be docile when handled correctly and are less nervous than horses. As desert creatures, camels also have greater stamina and can endure long periods without water. This advantage offered a certain strategic flexibility to commanders, as long treks in arid conditions could then be undertaken. When faced by conventional cavalry, the size and odour of camels caused horses to rear-up and back away in a fight. The invention of the north Arabian saddle in the 4th century BC made effective control considerably easier; the steady, elevated position of the saddle enabled an archer to scan the battlefield and pick his targets off with some ease."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_etruscan_military"	"The Etruscans, like the other eminent Greek and Latin peoples, had a strong military tradition. Like most other ancient societies, the Etruscans conducted their campaigns during the summer months, when the climate and weather were favourable to do so. Mainly, they raided neighbouring settlements, defended themselves against conquest attempts, and combated piracy. Warfare was considered an effective economic benefit - successful military efforts yielded strategic resources, prestige goods, and slaves. Prisoners were highly valued, to be ransomed back to their families at a high price or sacrificed to honour fallen leaders, such as those made by Achilles for Patroclus. The tombs of wealthy Etruscans were filled with shields, spears, swords, crested helmets and bronze armour, indicating their status in life. In cases where their equipment was damaged, representative sculpture was buried instead. The robust spear points and wide blades found in Etruscan grave sites resemble early Roman weaponry, showing their extensive adoption of the Etruscans' ways of war."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_kush_african_war_elephants"	"The now-extinct African forest elephants were smaller than the Indian variety. At around two to two and a half metres in height, they were an imposing beast capable of causing panic in enemies unused to facing them in battle. Having fought Syracusan elephants in Sicily in 278-276BC, the Carthaginians captured and tamed the local elephants rather than importing larger specimens from India. The Carthaginians did, however, hire Indian experts to form the most powerful elephant corps of the period. At Bagradas River in 255BC, the Carthaginian elephants caused many casualties, leaving the Romans fearful of battling the creatures for many years afterwards."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Persian_Light_Archers_Long"	"Very few Persians were professional soldiers and, apart from the earlier elite Achaemenid Immortals and some mercenary hoplites, none were formally trained or drilled. Instead, troops were levied by rich land owners as an obligation during times of war. Levied infantry included slingers, archers and javelin throwers, all wearing little armour but some with shields for protection. As might be expected due to the local terrain, cavalry was an important component in an eastern army, and several types were raised. Lighter cavalry wore iron or bronze scale armour over a tunic; these mounted warriors carried javelins and a sword but had no shield. Horse archers were used to wear down infantry with fast, ruthless attacks. Heavy cavalry included a royal bodyguard. The Parthians, and later the Sassanid Persians, developed all-over horse armour to protect their valued steeds as well as the fearsome cataphract warriors. These were as armoured as any late medieval knight."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Jovianii"	"Everything in the Roman Empire was structured, often to extremes. Even the highest echelons of the military had internal hierarchy. The defence of the Emperor, for instance, was broken into tiers, with the Jovian and Herculian units established as the most senior of the Imperial guards. The 'Herculiani' were named after the Roman divine hero Hercules, known for his strength and epic adventures. The Herculiani and Joviani were potentially raised from the sister Legions Legio V Iovia and Legio VI Herculia, stationed in the province of Pannonia Secunda. These two Legions, like their Herculiani successors, were charged with defending the Emperor's personal residence."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Persian_Generic"	"The Persian war machine differed greatly from that of the west. Gone was the reliance on a backbone of columns and infantry; instead, the eastern empires fielded heavy cataphracts, drawn from the nobility, as their main strength. These powerful shock troops were complimented by horse or camel archers, to harry the enemy and keep them under pressure. On foot, the Persians fielded light spearmen levies supported by an elite division of archers to back the cavalry and rain death upon the enemy. Also, the cataphracts were often aided by the hammer-blow of the terrifying elephant corps, upon which great importance was placed due to its magnificent power."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Median_Cav_Long"	"The Median people were once the rulers of an expansive kingdom spanning central Persia to Asia Minor, seizing the opportunity to create a unified Median state after the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 605BC. The Median Kingdom endured until 505BC when the Persian king Cyrus the Great conquered its lands and formed the Achaemenid Empire. Under the Achaemenids, the Median people were considered prestige citizens, with equal status to their Persian kin. They held power as government officials, generals and as 'satraps' or governors. In battle, the Medes were known for the extraordinary agility of their horsemen, which they used against the crumbling Assyrian Empire, outmatching their enemy's skilled cavalry with superior mounted archers."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Cal_Caledonian_Spear_Wall"	"During the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, barbarian raiding parties essentially consisted of foot soldiers armed with whatever weapons or tools they could find. As contact with Rome increased, the armament and tactics that raiders employed slowly developed alongside it. When Julius Agricola encountered the Caledonii in battle in AD 84, the red-haired Celtic warriors used large swords and short shields to knock away arrows and javelins whilst charging. After defeat at Agricola's hand, and later to Septimius Severus, the Caledonii discovered that the swift cavalry flanking manoeuvres used against them worked extremely well and, although considered a cowardly tactic, a spear wall enabled them to withstand and counter a mounted onslaught."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Kurdish_Archers"	"The origins of the Kurds are oft-speculated. One tale suggests they are the children of the Djinn, seraphic servants of King Solomon who remained on earth after their lord's death. Another legend states that the Kurds were founded by Melik Kurdim, a follower of Noah, after the biblical flood. Whatever their origins, the Kurds were first noted as mercenary slingers for the Seleucid Empire and Parthia. They are not referred to as 'Kurds', however, until the time of the Sassanids, when the founder of the empire, Ardashir, battled the Kurds and their leader, Madig. Their loyalty was fluid; they provided military support for both Rome and the Sassanids throughout antiquity, depending on which power was in overall control of their homelands at the time."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Grivpanvar"	"Grivpanvar, from the Middle Persian term for 'neck guard', were elite units that originated in the late Parthian Empire, but were fully adopted by the Sassanids. They were similar in many ways to the cataphracts - both horse and rider were heavily armoured and used as shock troops, smashing through enemy lines to soften forces for the rest to exploit. The Grivpanvar employed the Kontos; a long, wooden cavalry lance. Heliodorus claimed that the strength of the charge, combined with the length and weight of the spear, could impale two men at once."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Bac_Scale_Thorax_Hoplites_Long"	"Scale armour was common throughout the cultures of the ancient world. As the name suggests, it looked like fish scales, and was made from overlapping rows of small scale-shaped plates, attached to one another or to a backing layer of leather or padding. Scale armour was flexible and relatively easy to produce. Depending on local resources, all kinds of scales were made, including bronze, iron, leather, and hide, with horn being the most common. Because it was made from smaller pieces woven together, scale armour could be easily repaired. Before the Marian Reforms of 104BC, Republican Romans used the 'lorica squamata', a shirt of metal scales sewn onto a fabric backing. Cavalry also made use of scale armour: Scythian, Sarmatian and Parthian cataphracts were covered from head to toe in scale armour, as were their mounts."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Assault_Hexareme"	"As the centuries passed, naval tactics and needs changed across the Mediterranean. There was a move towards larger ships, which was partly an expression of dynastic or national power. These 'polyremes' - a term meaning many-oared - were not suitable for ramming work in battle. In practice, many of them had no more oars than smaller ships; what they had were more rowers per oar than smaller ships. A Roman hexareme or Greek hexeres had a couple of banks of oars with three men per oar, and appeared to be a larger version of a smaller ship. Even so, thanks their strong construction and tremendous weight, they were slow moving and largely incapable of the quick turns needed to take advantage of enemy mistakes. Instead, their wide decks and plentiful carrying capacity made them excellent fighting platforms for infantry or artillery. Boarding or long-range bombardment were the methods used to defeat the enemy; naval warfare had come full-circle in terms of fighting methods, even if the ships used had grown significantly."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_nab_nabatean_noble_cavalry"	"The Nabataeans, although in dire relations with the Seleucids, borrowed many Hellenistic practices. As their empire expanded, the Seleucids tried to fold many nearby territories into it, looking to put a hand on the lucrative trade routes of southern Arabia as well. In the numerous military engagements between the two states, the Nabataeans developed the need to copy the greater disciplined, better structured Hellenistic way of fighting. They also used captured gear and although they were bitter rivals, admired the Greeks for their culture and civilisation. Most famous of these encounters are the Antigonid–Nabataean confrontations in 312BC. In the first instance, Antigonus appointed one of his officers, Athenaeus to pillage Petra. He did so successfully, as the defenders were away trading during the night of the raid. Not only was their stock captured, but also families, to be traded as slaves. However, the Nabataeans quickly realised the situation and were able to hunt down the 4,600-strong army and almost wipe it out, with only a few dozen escaping. Athenaeus was not among the survivors."

They have an impressive history from their tribal beginnings, through their time as part of the New Kingdom of Egypt to the rise of their own empire, when the kingdom – or Kush – extended across large tracts of southern Egypt. They repelled multiple Roman advances, and even survived the sacking of their capital during the 1st century BC. Though their kingdom declined in late antiquity, the Kushites remained a geopolitical and military force to be reckoned with and were never absorbed into the Roman Empire. They were famed for their formidable archers, with man and bow working as one."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ara_Camel_Spear_Long"	"Camels, both dromedaries and Bactrians, were used by the eastern empires of the ancient world. Their pungent natural odour disorientated and frightened horses, and made sure they were valued as light shock cavalry. Over time, their use spread west across northern Africa and, reputedly, there was a detachment in Emperor Claudius’ conquest of far Britannia. Like other light cavalry they carried spears, and sometimes javelins, to harass and chase off enemy light cavalry, infantry and skirmishers. Their real strength came from the qualities of their camels, which allowed them to patrol arid areas without stopping so often to rest and water the beasts. Historically, the first recorded use of camels in battle was between Shalmaneser III of Assyria and the 'Twelve Kings at Qarqar' in 853BC. Widespread use does not seem to have begun until much later, as demonstrated by the hasty formation of camel corps by Cyrus the Great for the Battle of Thymbra in 547BC."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Pike_Long"	"A tightly formed phalanx of sarissa-armed infantry presented an almost impenetrable wall of spear points, especially to cavalry. The sarissa itself was a two-handed spear or pike, between four and seven metres long, and was adopted by the armies of Philip II, Alexander the Great, and the Successors that followed them. With an iron tip and a bronze butt-spike which provided balance and could be dug into the ground to bolster a defensive stance, it was an effective weapon for mass combat. When advancing in close order against the enemy, each man would occupy a square roughly a metre to a side, with the sarissas of the first five ranks projecting beyond the phalanx. On the defensive the phalanxes would close up, locking together with each man resting his shield on the man in front for greater stability. Such formations sacrificed manoeuvrability, leading to their main weakness on their flanks and rear. Philip II’s employment of the sarissa, and this new Macedonian-style phalanx, developed from earlier hoplite warfare. There is some debate as to whether his wounding by either an Illyrian or Thracian long spear, which killed his mount, may have influenced the sarissa's introduction."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Spartan_Women_Long"	"Although an outsider might consider the highly militaristic society of Sparta to be fiercely patriarchal, the reality was somewhat different. Mothers were honoured due to their essential role in producing its male warriors. Also, unusually for the time, marriage dowries were espoused in favour of matches based on personality and physique, rather than property and wealth. This was because the physical fitness of parents was considered paramount in assuring the health of their offspring. Spartan women were, like men, trained for physical agility from a young age, and married later in life as a result. Furthermore, wives did not perform domestic chores, instead dedicating themselves to training, childbearing and supervision of the enslaved Helots, who did all the physical labour at home and on the land. As up to half the male population were away fighting at any one time, this supervision was not limited to the household and fields; women had an active role in the day-to-day running of the city too."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_iapygian_tribes"	"The Apulia region of southeastern Italy was inhabited by Iapygian tribes, an ancient Indo-European people who were most likely Illyrians who had crossed the Adriatic Sea and settled. Three tribes inhabited Italy's eastern coasts: the Daunians, Peucetians and Messapians. All three spoke the same language, but were different in other aspects of their culture and traditions. Iapygians were similar to Greeks in that they did not have a centralised kingdom, instead co-existing as independent city-states. Relations between Iapygians and their Greek neighbours were initially peaceful and focused on trade until 473BC, when the Greek polis Taras attempted to conquer Iapygian towns. Apulian city-states participated in the Second Peloponnesian War as allies of Athens, providing archers for their expeditionary force against Syracuse. Ultimately, the entire expedition was destroyed, further damaging relations between the Iapygians and Greeks."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_sicillian_natives"	"Sicily's original inhabitants can be defined as three separate groups of Italians: the Sicani, the Siceli and the Elymians. Despite splitting the island between them, there is no evidence that they ever fought. Then, from around 750BC, Greeks began to arrive in Sicily and establish colonies, the most important of which being Syracuse. By this time, Greek culture was already prevalent in the Mediterranean and the local tribesmen adopted Hellenic ways with relative ease. As Syracuse grew into a large and powerful polis, its tyrants levied local troops for campaigns against Carthage (for territory) and Athens (for influence), looking to exploit the latter's weakened state following its war against Sparta. Due to the lack of warlike natives, and their unchallenged development on Sicily, Syracuse became one of the most well-known places in the ancient world until 212BC, when the Roman consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus besieged and sacked the city."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Car_Sacred_Band_Long"	"The Sacred Band were a phalanx of veteran spearmen, raised in Carthage, and trained and armoured in Greek hoplite fashion. They were unique in that they were drawn from the populace of the city itself, rather than being allies, levied subject peoples or mercenaries; these were the groups that normally made up Carthaginian armies. Chosen from the nobility and wealthy citizens, they were well trained and disciplined. Thanks to their social status they could afford the full panoply of hoplite armour: a bronze cuirass, greaves and helm, and a hoplon shield. In the case of the Sacred Band these were predominately white in colour. Armed with hoplite spears, tipped with an iron head and bronze butt-spike for balance, members of the Sacred Band also carried straight swords. Renowned for their valour, even in defeat, the Sacred Band was expected to fight to the last, and did so at the Battle of the Crimissus in 340BC. Their numbers never recovered and in time the pressure of Carthage’s wars with Rome meant that the Sacred Band was superseded by mercenary armies, paid for by Carthage's trading wealth. These armies still had small numbers of Carthaginian citizens and Liby-Phoenicians, but the Sacred Band of old was no more."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Aux_Cappadocian_Cavalry"	"Cappadocian horsemen were found in many armies of Asia Minor but were most common in the forces of Pontus and Armenia. Although they wore scale armour and open helmets, so as not to impair their vision, their horses were unarmoured, allowing a good degree of speed and manoeuvrability. As a result, the Cappadocians were certainly faster across open ground than the heavy cataphracts used by eastern armies by this point in antiquity, and were most often placed on the flanks of an army to counter infantry skirmishers or light horse. Charges into spear or pike-armed phalanxes would have been stupid, and fatal, however."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Afr_Large_Shield_Warriors_Long"	"The thureos, a large oval-shaped shield, became common throughout the Hellenistic world from the 3rd century BC. Made from wood covered in hide, it differed from the earlier Greek hoplon in having a central handgrip, which was protected by a vertical spine running the length of the shield. This in turn could be further reinforced by the addition of a wide metal strip that protected the grip and the user’s hand. Inspired by the sub-rectangular and oval shields of the Celts, possibly through contact with the migrating Galatians, its usage seems to have spread through the Illyrian and Thracian tribes before it was adopted by the Greeks. Although large, the thureos was light in comparison to the traditional hoplon, and was adopted by heavily-armoured peltasts. Named after their shields, 'thureophoroi' could fight as common peltasts, skirmishing with javelins, but could also form up with their larger shields and longer spears in a similar fashion to a phalanx. The versatile and useful design of the thureos meant it was used by many armies, including the auxiliaries and cavalry of the later Roman Legions."	"True"

Only in battle could a warrior earn the glory and wealth needed to improve their position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding the tribe's enemies. Spear-armed warriors were the lifeblood of German tribal forces.

War was not Apedemak's only area of dominion. He was clearly very important to the Meroitic royal family, for representations have survived showing him being honoured by kings, queens and their children.

Coming into contact with the Roman Empire, they soon became famous for their excellent horsemen. Having been defeated by the Emperor Constantine, the Taifali continued to harass their oppressors until finally pacified around AD336. However, this did not lead to their automatic absorption into the Roman Empire, and those Taifali who chose not to resettle within its boundaries became self-governing allies of Rome. This may have been due to perceived difficulties in successfully governing such a harsh, mountainous region, or because the Romans needed a buffer against an increasing number of incursions by the marauding steppe nomads."

Experienced in intricate manoeuvres whilst keeping formation, they were suitable for large-scale military endeavours, during which they were the primary cavalry escort for the infantry-heavy Legions. The alae riders typically wore heavy armour and were armed with a short lance, javelins or sometimes bows. Although their armaments were subject to change, all alae cavalry carried a spatha sword and the ubiquitous pugio dagger.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ind_War_Elephants_Long"	"War elephants had to be trained like men and cavalry horses to endure the noise and chaos of battle. Indian war elephants were larger than their African counterparts and strong enough to carry a 'howdah', or small wooden tower, on their backs. The driver sat astride the beast’s neck while two men, armed with javelins, were in the howdah. The African elephants of the period were a smaller, third species found in northern Africa, and now extinct; they were not the large, intractable wild creatures from sub-Saharan Africa which are familiar to us. The Indian variety first came to the Middle East when Seleucus, one of Alexander the Great’s Successors, invaded India in 305BC.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Eas_Eastern_Axe_Warriors"	"In contrast to their European opponents, eastern armies generally had lighter equipment. This was a function of the terrain and climate of their homelands, which naturally favoured irregular combat. As a result, traditional Persian warfare favoured skirmishing with few close combat engagements. Heavy armour was impractical in such conditions, as the oppressive eastern heat hampered soldiers already weighed down by chainmail or scales. Also, the metal needed to produce it was not cheap at the time. As eastern forces encountered heavier European warriors for the first time, the difference in equipment had a large impact on their way of battle. Under Sassanid rule, the Persian army was properly prepared for the expansion into southern Europe, as the reconquest of this land was high on the Shah's list of priorities - he wished to wipe out the stigma of his ancestor Xerxes' defeat at Greek hands, almost 1000 years before. In order to fight Rome's Legions effectively, eastern warriors began to be equipped with bulkier armour and heavier weapons such as axes and longer metal swords, rather than spears and javelins."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Bar_Screaming_Women_Long_Ger"	"Unlike their 'civilised' counterparts, barbarian women had power within their societies, and were not to be crossed. On the battlefield, they tended the wounded, brought supplies forward, and inspired courage. With a strong sense of personal honour, they called down the gods' curses and swore vengeance on anyone who wronged them. Although without formal positions in tribal politics, in some societies a woman could still inherit the influence of her husband or father, and this could be used to take terrible vengeance. Boudicca, the queen of the Iceni from eastern Britannia, is the prime example of a powerful woman - the revolt she started threatened to drive the Romans from Britain."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Hellenic_Cataphracts_Long"	"The Iranians and Persians pioneered armoured cavalry and the Seleucids were the first western, Hellenised power to see their merit for battle. Antiochus III, 223-187BC, used cataphracts to great effect at Panium in 200BC. His Egyptian enemies, led by Skopas of Aetolia, placed cavalry on the army's flanks to shield the infantry in the centre. A single charge from Antiochus’ cataphracts entirely scattered the Egyptian horse, exposing the Egyptian infantry's flanks and rear. They were unable to defend themselves against the next mighty charge; the entire Egyptian army broke, and Skopas fled to Sidon. This retreat marked the end of Ptolemaic rule in Judea."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Berserkers_Long"	"Howling like animals and biting their shields, berserkers took on the appearance of wild animals, entering battle in an almost trance-like state. Worked into a rage before combat, possibly through the use of drugs, they had little protection but were utterly convinced of their invulnerability against fire, blade and indeed any blow that came their way. At the time, berserkers were thought to be shape-shifters that actually became the animals whose skins they wore. Other, more rational views suggested that they were simply carried along by a wave of group euphoria. However, their intended victims did not have the luxury of considering the opponent that stood before them; berserkers fought with a reckless fury, making them very uncompromising opponents to face, and to slay a berserker was thought a most impressive act of courage. One theory behind the appearance of bearskins in the Roman army was the premise that they were trophies, plucked from the corpses of German berserkers and worn by the Romans as symbols of bravery and prestige."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_senones"	"Following the route set by Bellovesus and the Insubres, multiple Gallic tribes gradually invaded northern Italy, looking for fertile lands to settle. The last of these were the Senones, who occupied the territory between the Utis and Aesis rivers. In 391BC, the Senones' chief Brennus besieged Clusium, an Etruscan city, which looked to Rome for help against the barbarian threat. The Roman Republic sent three ambassadors, but they conducted a far from peaceful negotiation, instead killing a Gallic chieftain and causing war to break out between the Senones and the Romans. Rome's Senate paid little heed to the looming threat, failing to even elect a dictator. According to Livy, the Gauls marched on Rome so quickly that the Roman army was caught by surprise and were not even able to set up camp or build defences. Brennus led his warriors to attack a nearby hill, where the Romans kept their reserves. Seeing the slaughter unfolding there, the Roman army panicked and broke, with most of the men fleeing to Veii. The Senones themselves were shocked by how easy and crushing their victory was, an event regarded by Plutarch as "a disorderly and shameful battle"."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_centuriae"	"In its earliest times, when Rome consisted of several, separate hilltop settlements, there was no Roman army as such. Instead, warbands were fielded by the various Latin clans. In this era, Roman warfare tended to mean small-scale raiding and cattle-rustling against other clans and neighbouring hill tribes, such as the Sabini and Aequi. However, critical changes to its army during the 6th century BC saw Rome embracing Greek-style hoplite equipment. Romulus himself is said to have raised ten centuriae, each consisting of one hundred men from one of Rome's original founding tribes. When the Roman monarchy was replaced the Republic around 500BC, the army was divided into two royal legions, each comprised of 3000 hoplites, supported by an equal number of javelinmen and cavalry. According to Livy, in the early 4th century BC Marcus Furius Camillus made further important military reforms, instituting  pay for levied troops and standardising legion sizes."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Assault_Octeres"	"During late antiquity, an arms race for larger and larger warships took place between the various factions around the Mediterranean. Size, in terms of the number of rowers, ship length, bulk, and - above all - the majesty of the vessel became as much a tool of statecraft as of warfare. A people who could afford such ships were almost certainly rich enough to withstand the strains of any war. A 'four' or 'quadreme' was still a handy warship, able to manoeuvre in battle. The same could not be said of some of the large 'polyremes', a word meaning 'many oars'. Practical archaeology shows that too many banks of oars simply didn't work, so polyremes probably referred to the number of rowers; a septireme is likely to have had some seven rowers per bank of three oars, arranged in three, three, and two to an oar upwards from the waterline. As these bigger ships carried more rowers, they could also carry greater numbers of marines, arrow towers, and an array of useful artillery pieces."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_egyptian_one_halfer"	"The 'one-and-a-half' or 'hemiolia' was a light galley which was much favoured by pirates in the ancient world. It developed from the bireme, a ship that had two full decks of oars along its entire length. The hemiola reduced the number of oars on the upper level, leaving roughly half the number of oars and rowers in the midship section. The smaller number of rowers had little effect on overall speed because the laden weight of the vessel also dropped. Because it used both oars and sails, and the crew could rapidly change propulsion method, it was an ideal vessel for chasing down fat, wealthy merchant ships. Boarding attacks were mounted from hemiolas; ramming was not a useful tactic as loot ended up with the fish rather than enriching the pirates! The speed and handiness of hemiolas made them useful as scouts, supply boats and vessels used to pick off damaged enemies at the edge of battles."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Aux_Socii_Extraordinarii_Long"	"These elite soldiers, chosen from amongst the Latin and Italian allies of Rome, were often given dangerous or vital duties to perform. Socii extraordinarii were composed of roughly the best fifth of an allied infantry force, and led any column on the march, acting as scouts and occasionally forming a rear-guard. The city-states and tribes of the Italian peninsula who provided the Socii were expected to match Rome’s military contribution on any campaign. Those liable for service included Romans that had given up citizenship to live in the colonies and Latin neighbours of Rome, such as the Etruscans and Samnites. In return for providing half of Rome’s military might, they did not have to pay tributes and received half of any spoils."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Car_Snake_Pot_Ballista_Long"	"A ballista could be aimed effectively, but that accuracy came at a cost in range; it could fire no more than a distance of around 500 metres. Using a pair of torsion springs with levers inserted into twisted ropes made from animal sinew, the ballista was incredibly powerful for a machine of its size. Generally firing solid shot or bolts, it could also be modified to throw clay pots filled with snakes or scorpions. Equally effective against infantry or cavalry, it could also be deployed to destroy light fortifications during sieges. Originally developed by the Greeks around 400BC, and based on the oversized Oxybeles composite bow, ballistae were widely used by many cultures of the period, including the Romans. Later Roman versions included adjustable caps that enabled crews to quickly alter the tension of each sinew bundle to provide balance and therefore improve accuracy."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Aux_Gre_Rhodian_Slingers_Long"	"Perhaps not as famous as their counterparts from the Balearics, Rhodian slingers were nevertheless famed for their skill. As Rhodes was protected by the sea, slingers could hire themselves out as mercenaries across the Mediterranean. They were deadly at 100 metres and could hit targets at 400 metres. Unencumbered by armour, they were highly mobile and could outpace or at least match the pace of most other infantry. Rhodian slingers sometimes made use of small shields with a single handgrip to protect them from any return fire. During the Greco-Persian Wars shaped shot gave the Greeks, including the Rhodians, an advantage over the Persians. This proved essential in covering the retreat of the Ten Thousand, after Cyrus the Younger’s death at the Battle of Cunaxa in 401BC. The Rhodian slingers were the only missile troops able to engage the enemy with some safety, as Cretan archers and Greek javelinmen had the same range as enemy missile troops."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_sherden"	"The term 'Sea Peoples' is used to refer to various seaborne raiders and marauders who troubled the Aegean, the Near East and Egypt during the second half of the 2nd millennium BC. The collapse of many of the Late Bronze Age civilisations is attributed to the Sea Peoples, as their piratical ways swept across the Mediterranean. Among the first tribes to appear in historical records were the Sherden, who were defeated by Ramesses II in the second year of his rule and so impressed the Pharaoh that they were subsequently added to his personal guard. Multiple settlements, lands and goods were gifted to Sherden warriors in payment, confirming the elite status of the Sea Peoples within Egyptian ranks. It is believed that the Sherden were ancestors to the Nuragic civilisation on Sardinia, who inherited and maintained much of their martial legacy probably due to their relative isolation. Nuragic bronze sculptures, as well as their use of horned helmets, further supports the ties between the two races."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Armenia_Generic"	"The Kingdom of Armenia was a crossroads between Persia and Rome, and its military style was influenced by both sides. In late antiquity, Armenian territory was highly contested between the Sassanid and Roman Empire. Militarily-speaking, its archers were a source of remark, with some sources suggesting they could reliably kill from up to 200 metres. Its cavalry, too, was renowned, and that mountain people could breed such excellent riding stock was often a source of surprise amongst their opponents. Under the Sassanid Empire, Armenian cavalry was honoured as elite, alongside the Savaran, with a position of distinction at the royal capital, Ctesiphon."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Immortals_Generic"	"The 'Ten Thousand Immortals' were a military force of elite infantry divisions within the Achaemenid Empire, acting as both an imperial guard and an expeditionary army during the Persian conquests. They were so named for always numbering exactly ten thousand - if any man died or fell ill, he was immediately replaced; in this way the unit never 'died'. Herodotus describes them as “magnificently” equipped, glittering in gold and dressed in the finest armour. The Immortals were also afforded the best food and treatment befitting of their elite status. They famously fought at the Battle of Thermopylae, outflanking the redoubtable Spartans and ultimately securing victory. Although the unit died with the Achaemenids, it was revived much later under the Sassanids, helping to legitimise Sassanid rule as inheritors of Persian power."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Short_Swords_Long"	"These irregular, novice warriors were drawn from among the farmers, hunters and young men of the tribe. They carried Celtic shortswords, which were cutting and hacking blades, unlike the thrusting design of the Roman gladius. The shortsword developed from the earlier Celtic longsword, and was not as expensive to make. With little armour and only a simple shield these irregulars may have been lacking in equipment and skills but they made up for it by their numbers. Some warriors would also carry javelins or heavy, weighted darts to throw in the last moments before charging into melee. This gave them uses as both skirmishers and light infantry."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Rom_Evocati_Cohort"	"When a Roman Legionary completed 25 years in the army, he could be asked back to join the evocati, literally 'those who are called'. Usually affiliated to their old commander or re-enlisting at the bequest of a particular consul in times of need, veterans were afforded great respect and honour due to their previous service. As examples to the common soldier, they were often immediately promoted to the rank of centurion and given a pay rise. Crucially, veterans were exempt from the mundane and laborious tasks of legionary life such as digging latrines, building roads or making camp. During the 'Crisis of the 3rd Century', all sides called on old soldiers to swell their ranks and provide much needed experience; the veteran 'Praetorians of the Evocati Augusti' were held in especially high regard."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Horse_Skirm_Long"	"Cavalry skirmishers relied on the speed of their mounts to close quickly with an enemy, attack, and then withdraw before any counterattack. This was the main role of cavalry in supporting hoplites, harassing enemy phalanxes and skirmishers and only pursuing foes already on the run. Most used javelins, and some attacked using the 'Cantabrian circle', where riders would circle in front of an enemy, taking it in turns to throw their javelins before galloping to the rear again. A few skirmishing riders carried swords and small shields to use if forced into a melee. Thracian cavalrymen often strapped their crescent-shaped pelte shield to their backs, giving them a little protection when they withdrew, a habit that sensible neighbours would have copied."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Spearwomen_Long"	"There are several legends from the ancient period concerning the exploits of Germanic female warriors. Womens' graves have also been found to contain spears, shields, and daggers, indicating that they may have fought alongside their men on the battlefield, rather than in a purely defensive capacity when their settlements were attacked. It was certainly common for women to have status and power within Germanic tribal society; they were able to inherit them following the death of their fathers or husbands, and could even demand divorce following an unsuccessful match. In common with the traditions of their Celtic neighbours, the opinion and judgement of Germanic priestesses and female elders was highly respected by all."	"True"

The skilled swordsmen from this area followed a long tradition of elite troops from the south that begun under the Egyptian and Nubian dynasties. Although they went into battle wearing only simple cloth armour, the Aethiopians did employ Greek thureos-like shields. These sported a central handgrip, and offered greater protection than the hide-bound wicker or wooden shields of the sub-Saharan tribes. They also used a form of khopesh-like sword that would eventually evolve into the shotel used by the later warriors of Aksum. This had a forward curving, sickle-like blade designed to reach around an opponent’s shield, either to hook it away or pierce his vital organs."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Dac_Heavy_Skirm_Long"	"The Getae were a confederation of 'barbarian' tribes who settled near the Danube River in what are now parts of present-day Romania and Bulgaria. Whether they were ethnically Dacian or Thracian remains uncertain, as both the Greeks and the Romans drew opposite conclusions on the matter. The Greeks were the first to encounter them, as early as the 7th century BC, stating that the Getae were 'the noblest as well as the most just of all the Thracian tribes'. However, the Romans later concluded they were a people of Dacian origin. Whatever their etymology, the Getae were a formidable battlefield opponent for any civilised or tribal force. They were also first class raiders, famed for their hit-and-run guerrilla tactics and oft employed for that purpose by the regional powers of the time. Eventually, despite their military skills and undoubted bravery, the Getae fell foul of the greatest warrior of the age; at the end of the 4th century BC, Alexander the Great suppressed them at the beginning his legendary Persian expedition. However, after the collapse of Macedon's empire and a period of consolidation, Getae influence and control was again widespread throughout the Balkans and as far as the Black Sea coast, reaching its fullest extent during the 3rd century BC. The Getae remained influential until their defeat by the Roman general Crassus the Younger almost 200 years later, at which point their territory was absorbed into Rome's growing empire."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_ligurians"	"The Ligurians were an ancient Indo-European people from a region of northwestern Italy, to which they gave their name, south of the Alps. Strabo claims that they were different people to the Gauls, who also descended southward from the Alps, though many Ligurian customs resembled those of the marauding Celts. The expansions of Gallic tribes and Etruscan cities meant that Liguria's territory was heavily reduced, with some tribes even migrating to northern Corsica. Ligurians were viewed as a warlike people, and were highly valued as mercenaries, being employed on multiple occasions by Carthaginian generals and Greek tyrants alike. Ligurian pirates were also known to attack trade ships in the Tyrrhean and Ligurian seas, as stated by Diodorus Siculus and Strabo. Rome engaged in a long and drawn-out war against the Ligurians during the Republic's expansion, ultimately assimilating the native tribes into Roman culture during the 2nd century BC."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_etruscan_warriors"	"Etruscan armies, like most ancient Mediterranean forces, were drawn from a citizen body who were otherwise farmers when not at war. Soldiers paid for their own equipment and fought for the individual city-state to which they belonged. Etruscan warriors were heavily influenced by the Greek military style, with wealthier fighters going into battle with bronze breastplates and greaves, Corinthian-style helmets and round shields. Hardened leather armour was also used, which was more flexible, but did not offer the same level of protection. Etruria's early armies probably employed the phalanx style of combat, but as Gauls and other barbarians descended from the Alps and into Italy, Etruscan soldiers adopted a looser way of fighting. Common finds in Etruscan grave sites are bell-shaped bronze helmets, sometimes with cheek-guards, as well as shorter melee weapons, including swords and axes. Ultimately, Etruria's downfall was not due to the quality of its warriors, but rather the refusal of the various Etruscan cities to band together and support each other against the rising threat from Rome."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Riders_Hunt_Long"	"While the Germans relied primarily on the strength of their infantry, some tribes built reputations as skilled horsemen. Notoriously aggressive in their cavalry tactics, they often seized the initiative when faced with greater numbers. Their confidence as riders was also unshakable; turning their backs on new technologies and techniques, the Germans notably refused to use the four-horned saddle that had revolutionised the cavalry of their Celtic neighbours. Despite this disadvantage, they were brave enough to face all comers, as Julius Caesar himself described: “In their eyes it is the height of effeminacy and shame to use a saddle, and they do not hesitate to engage the largest force of cavalry riding saddled horses, however small their own numbers may be”."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Roman_Legionaries_Long"	"The military reforms of Gaius Marius in 104BC transformed the Roman army into a professional fighting force. Recruits were no longer required to own land in order to be soldiers: Roman citizenship was enough. Without farms to return to, men were willing to make the army their career, fighting lengthy campaigns in return for the pay, glory and retirement benefits. The Legions were equipped at the expense of the state, and each man carried a pilum, a gladius and a large 'scutum' shield, emblazoned with their Legion’s insignia. Under Marius men were expected to carry their own equipment, removing the need for large baggage trains manned by non-combatants. Unfortunately for the men this meant that they were carrying kit that weighed around 45 kilos, earning them the nickname 'Marius' mules'."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Levy_Freemen_Long"	"The Celtic client system meant that a 'freeman' was given opportunities by the tribal hierarchy. He had to serve the noble classes, but he could also earn prestige in his own right. A freeman inevitably became the follower of an aristocrat, working on the land and raising livestock. However he also had the right to bear arms and fight alongside the nobles during times of war. In combat, a Celt could prove his worth, making a reputation for himself. This system caused an appetite for battle amongst the ambitious lower classes. This did not mean that their armies were ill-disciplined or haphazard: their cavalry used 'trimarcisia', where each rider went into battle with a pair of freeman servants, ready to supply fresh mounts or replace a warrior who fell."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Armoured_Archers_Generic"	"On the battlefield, an archer's aim is either his greatest skill or his most glaring weakness. Arrows have great power and impact, but if aimed slightly off target are little more than a distraction for the enemy. Mainly, ancient archers used the broadhead arrow, used for both war and hunting. Some marksmen employed three-bladed broadheads, or tribolate arrowheads, that could easily cut through flesh. The larger, stronger men among their number were also equipped with heavier armour, ignoring speed for the ability to take an arrow themselves and not necessarily be killed outright."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Wolf_Warriors_Long"	"Germanic warriors inspired by death and victory often wore the pelt of the wolf, looking as fierce as a pack of rabid beasts when they fell upon their enemies. For the defenders, the experience must have been even more frightening than battle usually was, and probably seemed almost supernatural to most men of the ancient world. The wolf is a recurring image in German and Norse mythology, often associated with Wodanaz or Odin, who was the god of victory, amongst other things. Also, three wolves are prominently featured in the Norse pantheon and figures dressed in wolf-pelts are often depicted in the art of the period, where images of warriors fighting wolves or bears abound. There are also many surviving images of a wolf warrior fighting a bird-headed man, who was supposed to represent Wodanaz himself. In the Germanic world, the cult of Wodanaz was so large that people of the age often had wolf-related names, such as Vulfolaic ('Wolf-dancer'), Wolfhetan ('Wolf-hide'), and Wolfdregil ('Wolf-runner'). Wolfgang or 'Wolf-gait' has remained a popular German name to this day."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Lanciarii"	"Developed during their early part of the 1st century AD by the eastern empires of the time, the ‘kontos’ lance was at least four metres long. Designed to be used by cavalrymen, it was initially fielded by the cataphracts and clibinarii of Parthia and its successors, the Sassanid Persians. In fact the Parthian cataphracts who annihilated the Roman army at the Battle of Carrhae in 55BC may also have used an early version of the kontos. Literally as long as a bargepole, from where it gets its Greek name, a kontos was generally used two-handed whilst its wielder controlled their horse using both knees to indicate speed and direction. Later on, Rome faced this deadly new cavalry weapon again at the hands of the brutal steppe nomads who raided its borders during the 3rd century AD. As a reaction to having faced lance-armed warriors and come off worse, the Romans soon had their own version, spelled ‘contus’. The contus lance was still in use 1,000 years later by Rome's successors."	"True"

Phoenician civilisation reached its height around 800BC, when it was one of the first global economies, managing to maintain a vast trade network whilst being surrounded by voracious military empires. In 593BC, Cyrus the Great, leader of the vastly expanding Achaemenid Empire, conquered Phoenicia and divided it into four vassal kingdoms, providing Persia with a Mediterranean port for the first time. The decline of the Achaemenids, in turn, diminished Phoenicia's influence in the region, although its colony, Carthage, maintained a burgeoning trade empire for a few hundred years after."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Afr_Numidian_Cav_Long"	"Numidian tribesmen were raised with horses from an early age, riding bareback without a bridle and controlling their horses by tapping the beasts between the ears with a stick. Numidian cavalry were supremely agile, skirmishing with assured expertise before swinging around to escape as rapidly as they had arrived. Wearing only a thin tunic, they carried javelins and small wicker shields. At Cannae, the highpoint of Carthaginian military success, Hannibal’s right wing consisted of 3,500 Numidian cavalrymen. The Numidians attacked the Romans' allied cavalry and chased them from the field before returning to smash into the rear of the Roman lines. Considered the elite of the Carthaginian army during the Second Punic War, the Numidians' defection before the Battle of Zama arguably led to Scipio’s victory over Hannibal in the final stages of the conflict."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Bac_Royal_Guard_Long"	"The royal guard, a phalanx of elite spearmen who protected the kings of Bactria, resulted from Alexandrian and eastern influences. They wore bronze armour and Phrygian helmets, but carried smaller shields than was typical among hoplites. They were armed with Greek-style short swords and spears rather than the longer sarissa used by many western states. A half-way point between the phalangite and hoplite-like hypaspists of Alexandrian and later Successor armies, the Bactrian royal guard were used to protect the flanks of sarissa-armed phalanxes. Such elite units were a deliberate echo of Alexander’s patronage and reforms, and marked the move from the citizen-soldier, loyal to the state, to the professional soldier, loyal to his paymaster alone."

They were responsible for the judicial system and religious life of many tribes. Holding a great deal of authority within a tribe, a druid’s judgement in the settling of disputes was widely respected. Druids were not required to fight, but their words instilled vigour, vitality and invulnerability before a battle. Believing that the fate of men was directly connected to nature, druids appeased the gods and, according to the Romans, even turned to human sacrifice when necessary. Caesar spoke of "divine worship, the due performance of sacrifices, private or public, and the interpretation of ritual questions".

The founding of Rome divided them into two distinct populations, half being integrated into the new city while the other half remained a mountain tribe who later fought against their Roman neighbours. During the period when Rome had a monarchy, there was much conflict between Roman forces and the Sabine tribes, with the Roman kings celebrating triumphs for their victories against the mountain folk. Most battles ended in victory for the fledgling city, with Roman cavalry being key to the defeat of the Sabine forces. There was even the Bloodless War in 501 BC, following which Rome demanded restitution for the costs of all its past wars against the Sabines; when they refused, Rome declared war, but ultimately no battles were fought."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Thr_Nobles_Long"	"There were some forty tribes of Thracians who shared a common language and culture, inhabiting a vast area north of the Greek city-states. They were seen as war-loving, rebellious, rambunctious, bad enemies, and good allies in a fight. Many Greeks dreaded a time when they would be united under a single leader and sweep southwards. Such a turn of events never happened, but Thracians could be found across much of the Greek and Persian world fighting as mercenaries; they often specialised as skirmishers and light troops. At the Battle of Raphia in 217BC there were Thracians in both opposing armies, ready to do bloody work. The forward curving rhomphaia with its razor-sharp blade and long handle could lop off limbs in the hands of a skilled user, and Thracians were certainly skilled. The most famous Thracian 'general' of all never actually fought an action in Thrace or in command of a Thracian army; he was Spartacus, the commander of the last great slave rebellion against Rome in 73-71BC."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Aux_Illyrian_Generic"	"The Bellum Batonianum was a great rebellion in the Roman province of Illyricum, which began with an uprising of native Illyrian auxiliary recruits in 6 AD. Led by Bato the Daesitate, the Illyrian forces were supposed to join up with Roman forces to fight against the Marcomanni, but instead mutinied and defeated the Romans sent against them. It took the Romans three years to crush the revolt, which was considered to be the most difficult conflict Rome faced since the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BC. Since many of the Romans lacked rations and had to endure miserable conditions, they ultimately took out their frustrations on the enemy - brutally putting down the native Pannonians. The Illyrian people survived, however, with many considering that the near-genocide only made them stronger. By the 3rd century AD, the Illyrians were integrated to the degree that both Pannonia and Dalmatia were the main source of recruits for Rome's auxilia and Legions, which led to the majority of Roman Emperors of the late 3rd and 4th centuries AD hailing from the region."

As befitted their status, they were always kept in reserve until absolutely necessary, with the phrase 'going to the triarii' coming to mean any situation where a last resort was required to turn it around. As the wealthiest Roman soldiers of the age, triarii were well equipped with spears, breastplates and large shields, just like the heavy Greek hoplites from which they evolved. As the heaviest infantry in the early Roman army, they were positioned at the back of very large phalanx formations (and later simpler battle lines), the idea being that should a crisis unfold, the weight and combined experience of the triarii could - and frequently did - turn the situation around and lead to a decisive Roman victory."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Levy_Pike_Long"	"Throughout the civilised world, levies formed the backbone of armies. Drawn from the ordinary citizens or subjects, they were in a tradition that, in Greece at least, began with the hoplite warfare of the city-states. What levy pikemen lacked in fighting skills when compared to professionals and mercenaries, they made up for in numbers. Equipped with sarissas, or long pikes, these levy phalanxes were a formidable wall of spear points. Initially, the citizen-levies of Greek city-states were expected to provide their own arms and equipment. As time passed, however, the citizen army developed into a more organised body for which arms and equipment were provided by the state. At the same time, personal loyalty to an individual general or king replaced old-fashioned civic duty."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Ballista_Long"	"At close targets, a ballista could be aimed effectively but accuracy came at a cost in range; it could fire around 500 metres. The machine used two torsion springs with levers inserted into twisted ropes made from animal sinew, giving incredible power for its size. Firing either solid shot or bolts, it was equally effective against infantry or cavalry, but could also be deployed to destroy light fortifications during sieges. Originally developed by the Greeks around 400BC, and based on the oversized Oxybeles composite bow, ballistae were widely used by many cultures of the period, including the Romans. Later Roman versions included adjustable caps that enabled crews to quickly alter the tension of each sinew bundle to provide balance and therefore improve accuracy."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Evocati_Cohort_Long"	"After a Roman legionary had finished up to 25 years in the army, he could be asked back to join the 'evocati', the ranks of 'those who are called'. Usually affiliated to their old commander or re-enlisting at the bequest of a particular Consul in times of need, veterans were afforded great respect and honour because of their previous service. As examples to the common soldier, they were often immediately promoted to centurion and given a pay rise. Crucially, veterans were exempt from the mundane and laborious tasks of legionary life such as digging latrines, building roads or making camp. During the civil war all sides called on old soldiers to swell their ranks and provide much needed experience, Pompey persuading a large number of evocati to join him against Julius Caesar by promising them promotion and more money to return. The veteran 'Praetorians of the Evocati Augusti' were held in especially high regard."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Thureos_Spears_Long"	"Light Greek infantry, the thureophoroi developed around the early 4th century BC, and straddled the gap between the phalanx and the skirmishing peltasts. Named after the thureos, their large oval shields, they were more heavily armoured than the traditional Thracian and Greek peltast. Able to both skirmish and form up as a phalanx, they were used to guard the flanks and protect other light troops. Their shield, normally made from wood and covered with leather, had a central handgrip that was protected by a vertical spine and a metal boss-like strip, and may have been inspired by Celtic or Roman shields of the time. Like the longer sarissa, the spears used by the thureophoroi had a weighted butt-spike to provide balance, but this also allowed them to throw javelins, if so equipped, by jamming their spears into the ground. Able to fulfil a variety of roles, thureophoroi were common amongst both citizen and mercenary units of the Greek city-states until they were eclipsed by the Macedonian phalanxes of Phillip II and Alexander the Great."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_num_gaetuli_tribesmen"	"Drawn from a vast area and numerous tribes, the warriors of sub-Saharan Africa were unsurprisingly diverse in appearance and culture. They all possessed long and rich warrior traditions, such as the Numidians, the Nubians and their descendants who ruled Kush, and Aksum. Despite tribal differences, weapons and equipment differed only in detail: spears, javelins, bows and short swords were favoured. Relatively little armour was worn, but some tribes did employ wicker, wood or hide shields. Adornments and decorations varied greatly and some groups sported war paint. Aethiopians in Persian service were known for painting themselves chalk white on one side and vermillion on the other, and using spears and bows of palmwood. Fighting as allies and mercenaries for Carthage, Persia, and the eastern Successors, tribesmen could be found throughout Africa and Asia Minor."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_iolei"	"The Iolei were an ancient Nuragic tribe who lived on the island of Sardinia during the Bronze and Iron Ages. According to legend, recorded by Greek historians, their name can be traced back to Iolaus, a hero, who led the sons of Heracles to Sardinia and founded a colony there. The Sardinian people were content to live quietly in peace, keeping to the mountainous regions in central Sardinia, building nuraghe and subsisting on agriculture, animal husbandry  and fishing. However, around 900BC Phoenicians began sailing to Sardinia, establishing trade routes and relations with local merchants. As Carthage grew and set its sights on conquest and empire-building, an expedition was launched in 540BC against the Iolei, led by Malco. The expedition failed, as the Sardinians used guerrilla warfare - their skill with the bow and knowledge of the arduous terrain drove the Carthaginians from the island. Subsequent invasions of Sardinia, first by Mago in 509BC (as a response to Iolean attacks on coastal cities) and later by his brother Hamilcar. Eventually, the onslaught proved too great and the Sardinians were overcome. Coastal Sardinia was occupied by Carthage, but the Nuragic people remained unconquered, retreating into the island's central mountain range. According to Strabo, the Iolei were never truly subjugated, even following the rise of the Roman Empire."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Aux_Ita_Socii_Equites_Long"	"These equites were drawn from amongst the Socii, allied non-citizens who provided most of the early Republic's cavalry. As there were typically two or three times the number of Socii than Roman cavalry, a consular army of two Legions could have some 1,800 Socii cavalry, of which at least 600 would be considered part of the elite equites extraordinarii. By tradition, Roman cavalry was habitually deployed on the right flank, while the Socii equites were sent to the left. This imbalance was famously exploited by Hannibal at the Battle of Cannae in 216BC, when the Carthaginian cavalry under Hasdrubal routed the weaker Roman cavalry while the crack Numidian light cavalry waylaid their Socii allies, such was the difference in troop quality. Following the Marian Reforms, and the Allied Wars of 90-88BC, the Socii were reduced to nothing; as full citizens they were absorbed by the regular Roman Legions."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Onager_Long"	"Named after the wild ass with a dangerous kick, the onager catapult had a mighty kick all of its own, as crews quickly discovered. Although not accurate, it could hurl extremely heavy missiles over significant distances. Its throwing arm was pushed through a twisted bundle of animal sinew, held in a solid wooden frame. Pulled back, the tension in the sinew held an incredible amount of power until the arm snapped forwards and the deadly cargo was launched. The arm smacked into the frame, and it was this impact on every shot that made the entire machine lurch about unpredictably. An area-attack weapon, the onager was best suited to siege work, but it could be fired against tightly packed units of troops as well. The missiles launched could be as varied as rocks, clay pots filled with incendiary mixtures, and even dead bodies to spread disease and despair. Severed heads were gruesomely fired into besieged towns from time to time, as a warning of what was to come. Easily constructed from timber, the onager was used throughout the ancient world."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Cal_Caledonian_Heroic_Riders"	"The Celtic people believed that many supernatural creatures and spirits roamed the world around them, and that people could earn their favour or incur their wrath through their actions. Celtic hunters never dared to hunt without their deities' blessings, offering payment of domestic animals and heeding natural portents and signs. Oft-times, the most adept hunters were also the best riders; they aspired to be as powerful and fearsome as the Wild Hunt, the gods' sky-borne hunting party of legend. In battle, they saw the enemy as nothing more than prey to be chased and captured or killed. As relentless as bloodhounds and as fast as the whistling wind, they never gave up the Hunt unless death intervened."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Cimmerian_Heavy_Archers_Long"	"From the same root as the Thracian tribes, but ruled by a military elite of Iranian descent, the Cimmerians founded a kingdom of Greek colonies centred on Panticapaeum. Displaced from the steppes by their Scythian neighbours, some Cimmerians also migrated south of the Black Sea, settling in Cappadocia. Prosperous and wealthy traders, the Hellenistic world turned a blind eye to the Cimmerian tyrant kings, the import of vital wheat, fish and slaves outweighing Greek sensibilities. At their height, around 700BC, the Cimmerians had been mercenary allies of the Assyrians, and their armies had conquered Colchis, Iberia and Phrygia. With the migration of the Scythian tribes the fortunes of their empire dwindled, but their elite warriors continued to be valued as mercenaries. Their style of warfare was a mixture of Thracian, Iranian and Scythian influences, and principally focused on cavalry and chariots."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Noble_Blood_Cav_Long"	"Like the Companion cavalry of Macedon, these elite horsemen from the lands of Parthia and Pontus were recruited from among the nobility and social elite. Gradually they developed into a permanent and professional bodyguard force. Following both Hellenic and Persian traditions, they were armed with lances and armoured in a similar fashion to their Macedonian counterparts, but their mounts were armoured in eastern style. This gave their charges extra weight and meant that they were not only a counter to other cavalry forces, but could also be sent into the flanks of densely-packed infantry. The eastern influence also meant that the nobles were quite at home using the bow, as they had spent their formative years hunting from horseback."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Helot_Javelinmen_Long"	"An unfree class of non-citizens within Sparta's zone of control, the helots were slaves in most respects. Agricultural labourers, they worked the rich valleys of Eurotas and Pamisos, on which Laconia and Messenia were situated, and were forced to give up half of their produce to the Spartan elite. In addition, helots would also be assigned to Spartan citizens as household servants. Sometimes pressed into military service, helots would be employed as peltasts, and in some cases gained their freedom through such service. Following an earthquake in 464BC which devastated Sparta and possibly claimed as many as 20,000 lives the helots, mainly from Messenia, revolted alongside the perioikoi of Aithaia and Thouria. Cruel and bitter treatment of the helots by their Spartan overlords intensified after this event, and may have led to the tradition of the autumnal krypteia. A declaration of war against the helots made by the ephors, during the krypteia members of the Spartan agoge could prove their skill as warriors. Armed only with a knife, they were expected to live off the land whilst sanctioned to spy on, steal from, and kill the helots. However, this worked both ways, as any young Spartan caught by the helots could be beaten to death for allowing his capture."	"True"

Its curve, however, is much more prominent with an almost semi-circular shape. They were also used differently. Abyssinian warriors, fighting behind large shields, did not use fencing techniques. Instead, the shotel's main purpose was not to cut and slice; it was used to hook mounted warriors off their rides as well as to reach behind the enemy's shield when fighting on foot. Unlike the Afar guile, the shotel's upper edge is unsharpened and can be used braced against the swordsman's shield for strength. Collectively the shotel and the other Ethiopian swords are known as Han'e."	"True"

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Peltasts_Long"	"These skirmishers were named for their small crescent-shaped leather or wicker shields or 'peltai'. It was a common habit to name troops for their shield style in the Greek world. They wore little or no armour and carried three javelins. After harassing the enemy by flinging javelins, they would hastily retreat before any counter-charge or flanking move could be carried out. As armies developed and tactics became more complex, peltasts were expected to take part in hand-to-hand combat: with such expectation they were given stiffened linen cuirasses and short swords. They were still expected to use javelins, but could then join in the close fighting. Eventually, peltasts even exchanged their characteristic shield for the  heavier thureos. Their name and battlefield function remained unchanged."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_saba_merc_maas_gat_marauders"	"The warriors of the Sabaean region were light infantry, cavalry and archers, and fought as mercenaries and auxiliaries for the Roman Empire. Dressed desert-fashion, they were entirely familiar with and comfortable in arid places. This was secondary however, to their reputation as mostly-reliable fighters, of far more worth than ordinary citizens or levies. This was due to the independence that the Sabaean kingdom maintained from the 8th century BC to AD275. This record was based on military might as well as diplomacy and the spice trade including frankincense and myrrh. Never conquered by Rome, Sabaean warriors still found work as mercenaries and auxiliaries in Roman service."	"True"

Numidian cavalry were supremely agile, skirmishing with assured expertise before swinging around to escape as rapidly as they had arrived. Wearing only a thin tunic, they carried javelins and small wicker shields. At Cannae, the highpoint of Carthaginian military success, Hannibal’s right wing consisted of 3,500 Numidian cavalrymen. The Numidians attacked the Romans' allied cavalry and chased them from the field before returning to smash into the rear of the Roman lines. Considered the elite of the Carthaginian army during the Second Punic War, the Numidians' defection before the Battle of Zama arguably led to Scipio’s victory over Hannibal in the final stages of the conflict."

Oscan in origin, they are said to have migrated from the Apennine mountains, driving away or assimilating the indigenous tribes of Oenotrians, Chones and Lauternoi. In terms of their appearance and culture, the Lucanians were quite similar to the Samnites, wearing similar triple-disc armour and large, bronze belts over their tunics in battle. Lucanian tribes were warlike in nature; their forces fought their Greek neighbours on more than one occasion, against the Italiote League and Taras. According to Diodorus' chronicles, Lucanian warriors also participated in the wars between Dionysius I of Syracuse and the Greeks of southern Italy, joining the tyrant's forces as mercenaries. Rome also fought the Lucanian tribes, albeit late in the 4th century BC, during the Samnite Wars."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Spartan_Youths_Long"	"Toughened by years of training within the agoge, Spartan youths were moulded into warriors from the age of seven, becoming 'paidiskoi', or Spartan reserves, in their later teenage years. Separated from their mothers, the first stage of their training was the 'paides', in which they lived communally in one of the Spartan syssitia mess halls. Here they trained and exercised together, learning from their elders, and were purposefully underfed to toughen and accustom them to hunger, and teach them resourcefulness. This extended to depriving them of clothing too, providing only their red cloak each year. This taught the boys to steal, for which they were severely punished if caught, but for being caught, not for stealing from the helot slave population. At eighteen, they became paidiskoi, joining the army as reservists for two years. Armed with the hoplite spear and hoplon, and armoured in cloth, they would support the older Spartan men in battle. A chosen few would also be inducted into the krypteia, a secret organisation that were expected to spy on, steal from and kill the helots. Seen as both a test of ability and a necessary means of keeping the helots submissive, a declaration of war against the helots was made each autumn, effectively legalising the krypteia’s activity."

In times of war the horse had previously played a minor role, but gradually progressed from a symbol of prestige, and s noble warrior’s ride to the battlefield, to becoming a major presence in the battle itself. Blessed with horses of great quality, Iberian cavalry grew to become one of the most potent weapons of the ancient world. Their horses were as fast and nimble as the renowned Numidian steeds, and having been trained to cope with the rough terrain of the Iberian Peninsula, were hardy beasts also. This combination of fine mounts and dextrous riders enabled Iberian cavalry to establish themselves as mercenaries sought after by Rome."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_ara_slingers"	"Slingers were common in ancient armies. Slings are ancient weapons, dating back to Palaeolithic times. In comparison to bows, they were easy to make and had a greater effective range. Constructed from braided flax, hemp or rushes, a sling has a cradle where the shot is placed. One end has a finger-loop, while the other has a knot or strip giving a firm handhold. The slinger puts his middle finger through the loop and holds the knotted end with his thumb and forefinger. After whirling the shot in the sling it is released with a flick of the wrist. Quick to fire and reload, the sling was widely hated by those on the receiving end. Shot varied from stones collected in rivers to shaped lumps of clay and lead; lead shot could fly over 400 metres. Such missiles were sometimes inscribed with comments such as “Catch!” or “Take that!” Shot was difficult to see in flight, and although it lacked the penetrating power of an arrow it could easily break bone or stave-in armour at short ranges. Famously, the Roman Consul Paulus was killed by a slinger early in the disastrous Battle of Cannae."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Guerilla_Warriors_Long"	"Rather than face an enemy in battle, where they would likely be outnumbered and defeated, guerrilla warriors carried out hit-and-run attacks, using high ground, sabotage, and ambush techniques to weaken enemy positions. Knowledge of the local terrain is essential in guerrilla warfare. Iberians were certainly well-suited to such tactics, having developed their skills through centuries of inter-tribal feuding. The Greek historian, Diodorus, said the following about Iberian guerrillas: “for those that are young and pressed with want, but yet are strong and courageous, get together upon the tops of the mountains, and furnish themselves with arms; and having made up a considerable body, make incursions into Iberia, and heap up riches by thieving and robbery; and this is their constant practice in despite of all hazard whatsoever; for being lightly armed, and nimble of foot, they are not easily surprised"."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Onager_Long"	"One of the simplest forms of one-armed catapult, the onager relied on twisted skeins of animal sinew which provided the power to hurl either rocks or shot. Inaccurate but powerful, it was an effective siege engine against buildings and fortifications, but was of far less use on the battlefield unless firing into massed infantry ranks. First mentioned by Philon of Byzantium in his treatise ‘Mechanics’, the onager had a sling-like cradle attached to a firing arm. This arm was inserted and twisted to propel its shot through torsion. As the firing arm was released, the sling-like cradle would unhook, firing the projectile. A padded beam was incorporated into the housing frame to restrain the arm. Larger machines could require as many as eight or ten crewmen, and the incredible recoil meant that they could not be easily or safely mounted on walls or towers. Quickly constructed wherever wood was readily available, onagers soon became a staple of ancient siege warfare."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Car_Libyan_Javelin_Long"	"The javelin is among the oldest weapons in the world. Equipped with javelins and little else, skirmishers harried their opposite numbers and peppered hoplite phalanxes before quickly retreating. This was the typical tactic of all unarmoured, javelin-armed troops: to engage at range and then fall back behind more heavily-armoured infantry, or continue attacks while trying to stay just out of reach of the enemy. Such harassment could be highly effective, in 391BC at the Battle of Lechaeum, a force of Spartans, lacking the support of skirmishers or cavalry, were severely punished by javelin-armed Athenians who refused to meet them at close quarters. Over time, shields became common, such as those used by Thracian and Greek peltasts, but in turn these were rendered obsolescent by the Hellenic thureophoroi. Nevertheless, javelinmen and other irregulars continued to play a part in many armies throughout antiquity."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Youths_Long"	"The role of a skirmisher, lightly-armed and kept from melee combat, was not the part that young German tribesmen aspired to fulfil. Bursting with energy, they craved the glory of one-on-one combat. However, a fledgling tribesman first had to prove his worth before he earned the right to bear arms. If granted such an honour, he hungrily sought battle or risked growing idle. The strongest immediately joined a veteran warrior’s retinue, hoping to earn glory fighting alongside him. Typically, the young occupied themselves with inter-tribal warfare and raiding to prevent loss of fitness. Raiding other tribes was not recognised as a crime, but instead seen as necessary training for the young to nurture and maintain their appetite for battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Youths_Long"	"A Celtic tribesman reached manhood at fourteen years of age and, depending on his status, he could carry arms from then on. Nobles could also recruit their own following, building both reputation and influence through their clients, but proving their worth in battle was the start. Without bravery in a potential leader, no freeman would follow. A man's future, if he lived, was therefore entirely dependent on his showing in battle, and this led to bravery being a commonplace occurrence. Like their elders, Celtic youths were not above goading their opponents with insults and taunts, and they used 'carnyx' battle horns to instil fear in their foes. Inexperience, as with all young men, led them to sometimes act rashly where a little caution might have served them better."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Eastern_Skirmishers"	"Skirmishers harass the enemy, never giving them pause to regroup or breathe. Successful skirmish forces were often used to pin an enemy down whilst the vanguard prepared for the decisive attack. Eastern armies primarily employed skirmish cavalry, born of and entirely suited to the terrain upon which they fought and their cavalry-heavy structure. The javelin was an oft-used weapon for skirmishers, particularly from horseback. A rider could hurl his weapon at the enemy and be far away before they had time to react. If they were foolish enough to turn and face the threat, they could be blind to an infantry bulwark bearing down upon them."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_etruscan_roman_wars"	"According to Rome's foundation myth, as recounted by Livy, the Etruscans attacked the Latins, leading to the former's defeat and a peace settlement which made the River Tiber the common boundary between them. Following Rome's founding, on the banks of the Tiber in 753BC, conflict between the Etruscans and Romans continued for another five centuries, both militarily and politically. Veii, Fidenae, Tarchuna and Clusium each fought and were defeated by on Rome multiple occasions. The last three kings of Rome were actually of Etruscan descent, a result of the post-war peace treaties between the two states. When the Gallic warbands first defeated the Roman army at the Battle of Allia, prior to the sacking of Rome, the Etruscans tried to capitalise on Rome's disarray, seizing the opportunity to capture Roman lands for themselves. They began by besieging Sutrium, a Roman ally. On the same day that Sutrium fell, the Roman dictator Marcus Furius Camillus marched on the inferior Etruscan forces, compelling them to surrender and offering to spare their lives."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Cantabrian_Cav_Long"	"A specialist skirmish unit, the Cantabrians rode some of the finest mounts in the Iberian peninsula. These speedy and dextrous cavalrymen were renowned for their tactical skill, introducing their own distinct attack formation that best exploited their speed and skirmishing. In a 'Cantabrian Circle', the riders skilfully created a continually moving circle, making them difficult to target whilst ensuring a continuous shower of javelins rained down on the enemy. Incredibly effective at disrupting infantry lines, slow-moving heavy troops are their most obvious target. Enemies often broke ranks in an attempt to reduce casualties, but that played straight into the hands of the Iberian infantry. Having fallen victim to the Cantabrian circle on many occasions, the Romans later adopted it as a tactic for their own cavalry."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Gal_Gallic_Warriors"	"For hundreds of years, the Celtic warrior was the prime example of the quintessential barbarian fighter, standing over a head taller than their Mediterranean opponents. Their attacks in battle were fearless - as wild and savage as they were skilled and deadly. As the Celtic people spread across Europe, their warriors turned to new, different styles of warfare, often due to the local terrain and the natural resources available. For example, in Spain, they became master swordsmen; in southern Gaul, they manufactured impressive armour, preferring long swords. In Britain they continued to fight from chariots, adapted for use on rough ground. It took Rome 500 years before they managed to secure their territory against the Celtic warriors pressing against their borders."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Cohors"	"The Roman army was heavily structured, from the highest position down to the individual man. 'Legion' was the name most associated with Roman forces, but in reality groups of 'cohors' were formed and becoming the basic tactical unit around which all Roman infantry divisions were formed. The cohor was first used during the Second Punic War, becoming solidified following the military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107BC, and then codified in the 1st century AD. Each cohor consisted of several 'centuries' of eighty fighting men and twenty administrators, multiples of which built a Legion. Cohors also served specific purposes, such as the nine 'Cohors Praetoriae' - the legendary Praetorians who defended many Emperors, and toppled many others, until their replacement in AD312 following Constantine's military reforms."

During the 1st century AD, the Kushan Empire was formed in Bactrian territories, encompassing the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent. The Kushan dynasty had diplomatic contacts with the Roman Empire and Sassanid Persia, and was influenced by both sides. During the 3rd century AD, its empire fragmented into many small autonomous kingdoms that were easily conquered by the Sassanids. After the death of Vasudeva I in AD 225, the Kushan territories split into western and eastern halves. In AD 248, they were defeated again by the Persians, who dethroned the western dynasty and substituted them with Persian vassals known as the Kushanshahs (or Indo-Sassanids). The Kushan military had many influences, from the nomadic Yuezhi, who were the initiating force behind the Kushan Empire, to their subsequent Persian conquerors."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Warriors_Long"	"While Celts often lacked the formal organisations and tactics of their more 'civilised' opponents, they did have extremely able metalworkers, and long experience as mercenaries. In battle, they were not outmatched on an individual level by Romans or Greeks. Celts often favoured the spear in battle. It is a simple weapon, and a typical Celtic warrior might carry several into a fight: lighter javelins to hurl at the enemy on the approach or charge, and sometimes an iron-tipped spear for close combat. Some spears were crafted with barbed tips to cause further damage as they were pulled from wounds. Spears were also convenient for displaying trophies, in the shape of rotting enemy heads. This bloody appearance by the Celts, and a ferocious appetite for battle, was often enough to un-man opponents. Celtic warriors would send a chorus of chants, taunts and insults aimed towards foes, and blow their unearthly-sounding 'carnyx' battle horns. The whole display was intended to frighten foes, and put the warriors into the right frame of mind for battle."	"True"

A female-dominated society, descended from Ares, they were reputed to have lived on the shores of the Black Sea. According to Herodotus, the Amazons were killers of men and a popular source of artistic and poetic inspiration within Greek culture. When necessary, they intermingled with the all-male Gargareans to keep up their numbers, or enslaved the few men they needed after raids or battles. Depicted as superb archers, the Amazons are also often shown carrying spears, axes and crescent-shaped shields. Archaeology suggests Sarmatian and Scythian women participated in battle, which may be the source of the Amazons’ legend."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Bri_Chariots_Long"	"A war chariot was constructed mainly of wicker with iron-rimmed wheels and was drawn by a pair of horses. The main body was suspended from the axle by a rope, giving a rudimentary suspension and allowing it to travel quickly over uneven terrain. Each chariot carried two men, a driver and a warrior. The driver delivered the fighter into the action and then came back to make a pick-up; the warrior threw javelins and then leapt off to fight in close combat. Julius Caesar provides the most famous description of chariot warfare as he faced British chariots during his invasion of Britain in 55BC: “…they display in battle the speed of horse, the firmness of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness that they are accustomed, even on a declining and steep place, to check their horses at full speed, and manage to turn them in an instant and run along the pole, stand on the yoke, and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity to their chariots again”."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_nab_rekem_palace_guard"	"The Nabataeans, although in dire relations with the Seleucids, borrowed many Hellenistic practices. As their empire expanded, the Seleucids tried to fold many nearby territories into it, looking to put a hand on the lucrative trade routes of southern Arabia as well. In the numerous military engagements between the two states, the Nabataeans developed the need to copy the greater disciplined, better structured Hellenistic way of fighting. They also used captured gear and although they were bitter rivals, admired the Greeks for their culture and civilisation. Most famous of these encounters are the Antigonid–Nabataean confrontations in 312BC. In the first instance, Antigonus appointed one of his officers, Athenaeus to pillage Petra. He did so successfully, as the defenders were away trading during the night of the raid. Not only was their stock captured, but also families, to be traded as slaves. However, the Nabataeans quickly realised the situation and were able to hunt down the 4,600-strong army and almost wipe it out, with only a few dozen escaping. Athenaeus was not among the survivors."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_volsci_tribe"	"The Volsci were an Italic tribe that played a significant part in Rome's early history; Strabo mentions them as a sovereign state in the marshlands to the southeast of Rome. Volscian migration into southern Latium led to conflict, with the Latin natives under Roman leadership. Rome's seventh and final king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, was the first to go to war against the Volsci, initiating two centuries of strife between them. By the late 5th century BC, the Volsci had lost multiple battles and were increasingly on the defensive, eventually being incorporated into the Roman Republic near the end of the Samnite Wars. According to Livy, the relationship between Rome and the Volsci was not always hostile; during the approach of the Clusian army in 508BC, the Senate even purchased grain from the Volsci in order to feed the lower classes."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_rom_hastati"	"Hastati' were the remnants of the old third class of the Roman army, under the Etruscan kings, when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. They were a class of infantry in early Republican armies; they originally fought as spearmen, but later became swordsmen. Hastati were Rome's staple infantry unit following its overthrow of Etruscan rule. Originally some of the youngest and poorest men in the Legion, they could afford only modest equipment and light chainmail armour. They fought in a 'quincunx' formation - five points arranged in a cross - and usually carried scuta, large rectangular shields, and wore light breastplates (known as 'heart protectors') and bronze helmets, often with a number of feathers fixed to the top to increase stature and indicate status."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Agrianian_Axemen_Long"	"The Agrianes were a Paeonian tribe of fierce fighters. Known for their incredible dexterity and speed, they became an auxiliary infantry unit in the army of Alexander the Great. Carrying a clutch of javelins into battle, the Agrianes were able to move fast and strike hard. They wore little or no armour to hinder them and carried no shield. Alexander employed them time and time again as front line troops in many of his major battles, where they developed into an elite missile assault unit under the command of his general Attalus, proving especially effective in mountainous areas where agility was essential and the phalanx formation proved unwieldy. Carrying axes and knives that could also be used as climbing hooks, the Agrianes were exceptional not only at climbing and traversing difficult terrain, but also when assaulting man-made defences and walls. Fiercely loyal and extremely effective, they were also used to protect siege equipment before joining the crack hypaspists for the assault. Alexander rewarded the Agrianes for their service with the right to govern their own lands. Later an elite force of Agrianes fought for Antiochus at Raphia in 217BC against Ptolemy IV."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_num_armoured_desert_chariots"	"Perhaps influenced by earlier Egyptian and Hittite examples, some kingdoms in Saharan Africa adopted the chariot by the 5th century BC. Usage was most prevalent amongst the Garamantians, and Herodotus recorded them raiding their southern Ethiopian neighbours using four-horse chariots. Whether drawn by two or four horses, chariots were built for speed and manoeuvrability, rather than impact and protection. They consisted of little more than yoke and a platform with axle and wheels at the back and a waist-high screen. The driver and passengers wore cloth armour and used javelins, or in some cases bows. The emphasis on speed probably comes from the role chariots played in hunting being transferred to the battlefield, especially when raiding for slaves. Despite their weight, when many chariots were drawn up together their impact against light or untrained infantry and cavalry could still be devastating!"	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_insubres_bellovesus"	"Livy writes that during the reign of Rome's fifth king, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, a large number of Gallic tribes invaded Italy, coming first into contact with Etruscans dwelling between the Apennines and the Alps. At the time, the supreme power among Gallic tribes north of the Alps were the Bituriges, led by Ambigatus. The Gauls suffering from overpopulation, which encouraged Ambigatus to send his sister's sons, Bellovesus and Segovesus, to settle new lands and defeat any opposition. Following divination by the druids, Segovesus headed into the Hercynian Forest, while Bellovesus led his people towards Italy. No Gaul had crossed the Alps before, but after receiving support from the Greeks in the nearby port-city of Massilia, Bellovesus followed a divine omen and succeeded in making the hazardous journey. The Gallic tribes arrived in Etruscan lands and, when finding little more than an armed militia, slaughtered the Etruscan warriors, settling the area and calling it 'Insubria'. Shortly afterward, a major battle was fought at the River Ticinus, where the Gauls, now calling themselves 'Insubres', founded the settlement of Mediolanum. Following the route set by Bellovesus and the Bituriges, other tribes crossed the Alps into Italy, eventually leading to the sacking of Rome by the Senones."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Axe_Warriors_Generic"	"As more and more tribes turned to raiding in order to survive, the average barbarian found himself engaging his enemies with nothing more than an axe in his hand. Axes were an everyday tool, easily available before the European tribes learned to make swords well enough so they could be effective and not bend or break. Although seemingly primitive, the axe's weight proved to be very effective against armoured opponents and proved useful against shields, and its shape was useful for prying them out of an opponent's hands by reaching around and hooking them also. As tribes came together and confederations were created, raiding parties increasingly consisted largely of axe warriors - a great threat to the even the most organised and well-trained Roman armies."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Arm_Azat_Guard"	"Armenia has been ruled by many external powers: the Persians, Macedonians, and Seleucids all played a part in forging the land and its people during antiquity. The land-owning nobility - known as the Azat - were descended, so they claimed, from the Armenian gods, and like the nobles of many lands fought as cavalry. As a result, Armenia produced elite, heavily-armed and armoured cavalry that served as superb, mobile bodyguards for their rulers. Historically, the Azat carried lances, as well as longswords, maces or axes, making them deadly in close-quarters combat. The Azat can be considered forerunners of the chivalric knights of the Medieval era, obsessed with personal honour, loyalty, and status."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Rom_Equites_Promoti"	"Since Rome's beginnings, as was common in almost all ancient societies, the noble class were the only people who could afford horses, and were therefore most likely to own one. As a result, early Roman armies fielded cavalry consisting entirely of nobles - the equestrian class - and then bolstered their comparatively small numbers with units formed from the Empire's allies. Due to a number of high profile defeats, Roman cavalry contingents were generally considered to be far weaker than their Italian counterparts. Eventually, Rome's allies were granted Roman citizenship and, following a number of reforms to the army's structure, were folded into its ranks. Wherever the Romans went after that they drew on local specialists to swell their numbers as auxiliary troops."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Scorpion_Long"	"The scorpion is a smaller form of the ballista, operating on the same principles of a torsion-powered bow. It was operated by one man, and was incredibly accurate at short ranges. It could be used as a sniper's weapon, but was often deployed for indirect battery fire where the high rate of fire could unleash a withering hail of bolts to completely pepper an area. Scorpions were popular with the Romans, where they were used to support the Legions. Batteries had sixty scorpions, each of which was capable of firing three or four shots per minute. Like its larger counterpart, the ballista, the Greeks originally developed the scorpion, but its deadly nature led to rapid adoption by many nations. In most designs, power came from two wooden levers inserted into twisted skeins of animal sinew which, when the arms was pulled back, provided incredible power."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_saba_sabaean_archers"	"The warriors of the Sabaean region were light infantry, cavalry and archers, and fought as mercenaries and auxiliaries for the Roman Empire. Dressed desert-fashion, they were entirely familiar with and comfortable in arid places. This was secondary however, to their reputation as mostly-reliable fighters, of far more worth than ordinary citizens or levies. This was due to the independence that the Sabaean kingdom maintained from the 8th century BC to AD275. This record was based on military might as well as diplomacy and the spice trade including frankincense and myrrh. Never conquered by Rome, Sabaean warriors still found work as mercenaries and auxiliaries in Roman service."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Scorpion_Long"	"An ancestor of the medieval crossbow, this dart-firing ballista still required a sizable wooden stand and could not easily be moved by its single crewman. It was accurate at short ranges for sniping individuals, but could also be fired indirectly, with groups of several scorpions often deployed to form a battery in the field. Like the ballista, it was an improvement on the earlier gastraphetes, or belly-bow, and utilised either a composite bow or torsion springs to launch both flighted and flightless bolts. Incredibly powerful for its size, the scorpion required the crewman to ratchet back the drawstring with a windlass and lever. Even so, the rate of fire was high, and a skilled operator could loose three to four bolts a minute while firing indirectly. Easy to construct with the right raw materials, the required metal parts could be transported in the baggage so scorpions could be quickly assembled."	"True"

They typically guarded the royal capital, acting as a final line of defence against invaders. Amongst them were the Gyan-avspar, the 'sacrificers of their lives', known as the best of the Pushtigban, they were willing to give their lives in the name of their king, as they did with gusto during the Roman Emperor Julian's invasion of Persia. Fittingly, the royal bodyguards disappeared as an official unit with the death of Yazdegerd, the last Sassanid king, truly dying with their royal charge."	"True"

King Midas - he of the golden touch - was a mythical king of Phrygia, as was his father, Gordias, who created the Gordian Knot - a famous anecdote for lateral thinking. Phrygia was conquered by the expanding Achaemenid Persian Empire in approximately 540BC, and their lands were incorporated as the Lydian Kingdom fell. The Phrygians were renowned for their infantry, with light javelinmen and spears being the mainstay of their forces. They were notably present in 355BC, during the passionate but ultimately unsuccessful revolt by Artabazos II against his Persian overlords."	"True"

When the king of Lydia, Croesus, was defeated by the Achaemenid Empire in 547BC, Ionian lands were left vulnerable. Subjugated by the Persians, they retained a deal of theoretical independence, but found themselves at the whim of local tyrants. In 499BC, at the behest of one of these tyrants, the Ionians initiated a revolt which was the ultimate catalyst for the first Greco-Persian war. Their position - so close to both Persia and the Greek states of the Peloponnese - meant that Ionian cities were often caught in the ongoing conflict between them."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Mer_Syrian_Armoured_Elephants_Long"	"War elephants were not battle-winning weapons on their own. They had to be used properly and given the right support if they were to break an enemy line and, with it, the will to fight on. Often, elephants were accompanied into battle by a screen of friendly skirmishers, whose job it was to keep them from being harassed by the enemy’s own light troops before charging. The sheer size of an elephant was enough to instil terror even before it hurled men away, impaled them on its tusks, or trampled them to death. Even in the best battle conditions elephants could be unpredictable: they often reacted angrily if their handlers were killed or wounded, but could also turn on those same men when the stress of battle pushed them to breaking point. However, sent forward at the right moment, war elephants could sweep away all before them. Indian elephants first came to the Middle East when Seleucus, one of Alexander the Great’s Successors, invaded India in 305BC. 500 war elephants were handed over as part of the peace treaty between the Seleucid dynasty and the Mauryans of India, and the Seleucids went on to breed many more from this initial stock. War elephants remained an important part of the Seleucid army until their defeat by the Romans at Magnesia in 190BC, following which they were forbidden from breeding more."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Slingers_Long"	"As far as the Celts were concerned, the best way to kill a man was in hand-to-hand combat. The Celts thought there was great value in personal bravery and there was no honour in killing from a distance. Even so, slingers, javelinmen and archers still had their place on the battlefield. It was often the only way that some Celts could go to war: Celtic warriors paid for their own equipment, so only the wealthy could afford, or had the right to carry, fine armour and weapons. Skirmishers were usually the poor: freemen who served as clients to the noble class. While they could never hope to achieve the same status as their noble masters, they could still prove their worth in the cut and thrust of battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Slingers_Long"	"The German tribesman grew up throwing the stones found on the river beds of northern Europe, giving him a natural advantage when applying the skill to combat. Rocks and stones were in ready supply, so whilst spears may have needed repair after a battle, slingers were always well provisioned. Poor men of low status, both in society and subsequently in battle, slingers would typically take up position behind veteran warriors, protecting them from enemy attacks. In return, the veterans would use their shields to safeguard those behind them as they unleashed their rain of missiles. Slingshot could be an effective weapon against close enemy formations or cavalry."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Sax_Geoguth_Generic"	"While not as disciplined as Roman Legionaries, Rome's attempts to incorporate Germania into its empire left its mark on Germanic armies, particularly the various tribal factions settled along the borders, who served as a buffer and fought as foederati for the Romans. Surely influenced by Rome's burgeoning Legions, the Saxoni developed remarkable military organisation for a northern Germanic tribe. Warriors were grouped into warbands, each with its own chief, and were further categorised into classes. Of these, the Gedriht were the personal retainers of the chief, who swore an oath to die with their leader. The Geoguth were the youngest warriors, who formed the bulk of a warband and fought on the frontline. The Duguth were older, veteran warriors, who had earned their positions but may not have been as swift as their younger counterparts. Naturally, the best equipment was reserved for the Gedriht, while the other two classes shared what little weapons and armour were left - metal and metalworking skills were uncommon in Germania at this time. The elite warriors were also responsible for starting the baritus, the infamous, terrifying Germanic war-chant."	"True"

Its curve, however, is much more prominent with an almost semi-circular shape. They were also used differently. Abyssinian warriors, fighting behind large shields, did not use fencing techniques. Instead, the shotel's main purpose was not to cut and slice; it was used to hook mounted warriors off their rides as well as to reach behind the enemy's shield when fighting on foot. Unlike the Afar guile, the shotel's upper edge is unsharpened and can be used braced against the swordsman's shield for strength. Collectively the shotel and the other Ethiopian swords are known as Han'e."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Roman_Hastati_Long"	"During the 4th century BC the Romans abandoned the phalanx in favour of armies consisting chiefly of hastati, principes and triarii. These were deployed in maniples: compact blocks of men, arranged in a checkerboard formation. This allowed flexibility when moving across the battlefield, particularly when compared to the sluggish movements of a solid pike phalanx. Like most sophisticated city-states of the ancient world, Rome expected its men to fight, and supply their own war gear when they did so. A cynical observer might be tempted to note that the manipular Legion also made sure that the hierarchy of Rome was preserved. The youngest and least wealthy became hastati, the first line of battle in a Roman Legion. Behind them came the second line of principes, older and richer men, and finally came the triarii, the most experienced warriors. “Going to the triarii” was a Roman saying that came to be used in all kinds of situations, implying that everything else had been tried and found wanting."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Rom_Equites"	"Recruited from the gentry and lower aristocratic classes of Roman society, equites were the cavalrymen of the royal and early Roman armies. To be a member of the equestrian class meant that a man was rich enough to keep a horse, and provide his own armour, shield and spear. There were usually some 300 equites in each Legion, organised into ten turmae of thirty horsemen each under the command of three decuriones. One of these men would be the praefectus, or commander, of the squadron. Mostly drawn from the young sons of elite society, these were men keen to show their courage; showing prowess on the battlefield was an important step towards gaining political office and prestige for their families. Mundane duties such as patrol or reconnaissance would be the work of the allied cavalry. Augustus had opened the equites’ ranks to first class commoners. Although they received none of the equestrians' social and political powers, they eventually replaced the aristocracy in the ranks of the Roman cavalry, allowing the equestrians to become senior officers in the new Legions."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Aux_Egyptian_Generic"	"During the period of Roman rule, native Egyptian troops tended to support their Roman rulers. With a military legacy thousands of years old, the sons of the desert were commonly used as peltasts, skirmishers on the flanks of the Legionaries or as infantry in difficult terrain. Each Egyptian regiment could be identified by the weapon they carried - archers, spearmen, swordsmen, etc. The strong performance of the Egyptians in battle led to a greater proportion of native warriors forming auxiliary units, and as time passed and they gained their Roman commander's trust, they were give more diverse roles in battle. There were a series of revolts in Egypt throughout the 3rd century AD when Zenobia, the Palmyrene queen, took over the province after conquering it in AD 269, declaring herself 'Queen of Egypt' and backing it up by claiming she was descended from Cleopatra, the region's final Hellenic queen prior to its cessation to Rome."

They all possessed long and rich warrior traditions, such as the Numidians, the Nubians and their descendants who ruled Kush, and Aksum. Despite tribal differences, weapons and equipment differed only in detail: spears, javelins, bows and short swords were favoured. Relatively little armour was worn, but some tribes did employ wicker, wood or hide shields. Adornments and decorations varied greatly and some groups sported war paint. Aethiopians in Persian service were known for painting themselves chalk white on one side and vermillion on the other, and using spears and bows of palmwood. Fighting as allies and mercenaries for Carthage, Persia, and the eastern Successors, tribesmen could be found throughout Africa and Asia Minor."	"True"

Afterwards, Carthage was unwilling to risk many of its own citizens again in a single struggle. This reluctance led to the greater use of mercenaries during the Punic Wars against Rome. However, some Carthaginians were in the field at Cannae, the greatest single Roman defeat of the period. Their trusted commander, Muttines, later betrayed the Sicilian stronghold of Acragas to the Romans following the Carthaginian senate's change of heart towards Hannibal towards the end of the Second Punic War.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Alani_Generic"	"The Alans, or Alani, were a Sarmatian people, probably of Iranian or Turkish origin. Like other nomads, livestock formed the basis of their sustenance, so a land's suitability for grazing was a major factor when deciding where to settle. Famed for their skill as horse breeders, even the Romans wrote favourably of the Alans' talents. This fine breeding stock gave their warriors an edge in mounted combat; horse and rider had to perform a variety of manoeuvres very quickly, so man and beast constantly trained together to ensure this. The Alani's use of armoured cavalry and horse archers, along with the tactics they employed, made them a formidable foe. They had a heavy influence on Gothic tribes that expanded into the steppes, being responsible for the Gothic horsemanship that caused Rome to quake in fear."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Beehive_Onager_Long"	"Named after the wild ass with a dangerous kick, the onager catapult had a mighty kick all of its own, as its crews quickly discovered. Although not accurate, it could hurl extremely heavy missiles over significant distances. Its throwing arm was pushed through a twisted bundle of animal sinew fixed into a solid wooden frame. Pulled back, the tension in the sinew held an incredible amount of power until the arm snapped forwards and the deadly cargo was launched. At this point, the arm smacked into the frame, and it was this impact from every shot that made the entire machine lurch unpredictably. An area-attack weapon, rather than a deadly-accurate one, the onager was best suited to siege work, but could also be fired against tightly packed units of troops. It could be used to launch a variety of missiles: rocks, clay pots filled with incendiary mixtures or stinging animals such as bees, and even dead bodies to spread disease and despair. Somewhat gruesomely, severed heads were fired into besieged towns from time to time as a warning of what was to come. Easily constructed from timber, the onager became a popular weapon throughout the ancient world."	"True"

They lived a primarily unassuming, rural life in what most would consider inhospitable conditions, yet their territory was of vital strategic value to the Spartans as it controlled the road to Tegea, one of the most important religious centres in ancient Greece. The Skiritai comprised a lochos - or battalion - of elite light infantry whose fighting prowess on the extreme left of the battle line was so respected that the position was reserved exclusively for them. They were also sentinels, riding ahead of the army, and were the only units allowed to precede the king, making sure the way was clear before he arrived."	"True"

Along with Sparta it was one of Athens' chief adversaries; the two cities rivalled one another long before the Peloponnesian War, first coming to blows in the 6th century BC. Thebes was looked on suspiciously by other Greek states for its willingness to side with Persia simply to spite Athens. Thebes was famous for its 'Sacred Band', an elite infantry unit of 150 pairs of male lovers, who were said to fight with such skill and ferocity because, according to Plato, the soldiers "would be ready to die a thousand deaths" rather than let their partners die. Despite its heroic, unlikely victory against Sparta at Leuctra in 370BC, Thebes was eventually destroyed by Alexander the Great, purportedly to scare Athens into submission!"	"True"

Colonising the African coast from around the 1st millennium BC, the Phoenicians founded Carthage and other cities, later known as Leptis Magna and Sabratha. Important trading centres, they acted alongside Tingis, which was founded by their Carthaginian descendants, and the Greek colony of Cyrene as gateways into Africa and the western Mediterranean. By the 5th century BC, however, the three Libyan cities had passed under the control and protection of Carthage and its mercantile dominance. Mixing together a variety of eastern and Saharan customs, and influenced by contact with much of the Mediterranean through their trading network, the Liby-Phoenicians were varied in their style of dress and armament."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Aux_Infantry_Long"	"Auxiliaries supplemented the Legions of the late Republic and Principate and were recruited from non-citizens, usually provincial volunteers or from allied kingdoms. With the pressures of war requiring increasing numbers, especially in the aftermath of the Social War of 91-88BC, recruitment from Rome’s expanding provinces became a necessity. To limit the risk of rebellion, auxiliary units were recruited from a single province but always stationed far from home. Auxiliaries could be infantry, cavalry or specialists such as archers, and retained their own cultural identities and equipment. Being stationed in Roman provinces, under Roman rule, had an inevitable Romanising effect on auxiliaries, as did the rewards of service: land and citizenship. Some units eventually had 'Civium Romanorum' as a title, meaning they were Roman citizens. From as early as Caesar’s Gallic campaigns auxiliaries accounted for nearly all Roman cavalry, and during the 2nd century AD auxiliary numbers actually exceeded those of the Legions."	"True"

Said to have been part of the Lucanian people, at some point the Brutii split from them and formed their own group. According to Dionysius, Brutti is the Lucanian word for 'slaves' or 'rebels', which explains the nature of the conflict between the two tribes. The Greek settlers of the Italiote League fought multiple battles against the Brutti, as they had raided and sacked nearby Greek settlements. Being Oscans in origin, the Brutti fought less with organised spear formations and more with short swords and axes, as well as supporting cavalry. Oscan warriors shared the same view of battle in that the best tactic was to achieve a quick victory; the charge would be led by warriors with two spears, one to be thrown after reaching the enemy and the other to use in close combat."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Egy_Infantry_Long"	"Native troops supported the Greek phalanxes of Ptolemaic Egypt. Brave and proud warriors, Egyptians fulfilled several roles, but were most commonly used as peltasts, skirmishers on the flanks of the phalanxes, or as non-phalanx infantry in difficult terrain. Although the Ptolemies adopted all the trappings of the Pharaohs and their religious infrastructure, there was still much unrest among the native population long after the succession. This was due mainly to the way the Greek overlords used the traditions of the Pharaohs to fill their coffers at the expensive of ordinary people. The core of Ptolemaic armies was always Greek until the Battle of Raphia in 217BC, when they faced such a large Seleucid force and Ptolemy IV was forced to muster some 30,000 native Egyptians for the first time. Need overcame the suspicion of the disenchanted natives; the performance of the Egyptians in battle eventually led to a greater proportion of native troops in the Egyptian army and, in time, more diverse roles for those men as they gained the trust of their Greek commanders."

They repelled multiple Roman advances, and even survived the sacking of their capital during the 1st century BC.

Regardless of whether the last two parts ring true or not, Thessalian heavy cavalry were without doubt a highly disciplined, mobile and esteemed allied unit in Greek armies. Similar in many respects to the hetairoi, the Macedonian companion cavalry, both units used the xyston double-ended lance, but some evidence suggests that at times shorter spears and javelins may also have been used. Their mobility came from the rhombus formation they adopted, reputedly invented by Jason of Pherae, that enabled a unit to turn with cohesion, form up and charge on any of its four points. During Alexander’s campaigns, the contingent of Thessalian Cavalry accompanying him numbered roughly 2,000 men, 200 for every vote Thessaly had in the League of Corinth. They were commonly assigned the left flank, guarding it from enemy cavalry as the right flank spearheaded the attack."	"True"

Coming into contact with the highly aggressive Boii, the Cimbri made several attempts to displace them, but were defeated and moved onto land occupied by the Taurisci, a confederation of Celtic tribes allied to Rome. Following negotiation with the Romans, however, they agreed to move on. Although pretending to escort the Cimbri to their frontier, the Romans instead ambushed them. This was a miscalculation, as the subsequent battle led to their decisive defeat. In fact, had a violent storm not intervened, the entire Roman force may have been annihilated.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Shield_Bearers_Long"	"Meaning shield bearer or shield carrier, the Macedonian hypaspist developed out of the foot squires of the Companion cavalry. Rising to prominence under Alexander the Great, these chosen foot soldiers were equipped more like their hoplite predecessors than the new sarissa-armed phalangite infantry of the Macedonian phalanx. Armoured in linothorax, a cuirass of linen reinforced with metal, and a helmet, greaves and the apsis shield, they were more heavily equipped than their phalangite counterparts. Even with the increased weight, the shield bearer’s armament of spears and short kopis swords made them more flexible in battle than the less manoeuvrable phalangite. Because of this they usually guarded the vulnerable flank of such sarissa-armed phalanxes and, as an elite body, held the place of honour on the army’s right flank between the phalangites and the Companion cavalry. Alexander’s hypaspists influenced the adoption of such units by many of his Successors, and their use continued within the Macedonian army for quite some time. Eventually the shield bearer role developed into a rank of lower staff officers spread throughout the army, reporting directly to the king."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Balearic_Slingers_Long"	"Raised from infancy to perfect their use of the sling, these famed warriors came from the Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean. It is said that Balearic mothers did not allow their sons to eat until they had knocked their bread off a wall from a fair distance away. The slings they used were made from hair and animal sinew and, as adult warriors, each slinger carried three types for use at different ranges. Many slingers standing together produced a wave of shot that pierced armour and shattered bone, making them deadlier than even the very best archers. In fact, the Roman general Lucius Aemilius Paullus took a mortal wound to the head from slingshot during the opening minutes of the catastrophic Battle of Cannae. Not surprisingly, due to their geographical location, Balearic slingers were much sought after as mercenaries to fight both for and against Rome, and were reportedly paid in women rather than silver or gold!"

Parthia's military legacy was strongly represented in the new Persian army. It relied on heavy, armoured, noble cavalry and light horse archers consisting of lesser nobility and nomadic mercenaries. As ever, tribal peasants made the bulk of the Hamspah or levy infantry. They were used as the rear guard but were next to useless as soldiers due to their crude arms, meagre training and poor motivation, since the best equipment and drill was reserved for the horsemen who could afford it. Whenever the Hamspah were not standing in line as spearmen, the everyday duties of the camp fell to them, such as guarding the baggage."	"True"

As Rhodes was protected by the sea, slingers could hire themselves out as mercenaries across the Mediterranean. They were deadly at 100 metres and could hit targets at 400 metres. Unencumbered by armour, they were highly mobile and could outpace or at least match the pace of most other infantry. Rhodian slingers sometimes made use of small shields with a single handgrip to protect them from return fire, which enabled them to keep position rather than retreat following a volley."	"True"

Dressed desert-fashion, they were entirely familiar with and comfortable in arid places. This was secondary however, to their reputation as mostly-reliable fighters, of far more worth than ordinary citizens or levies. This was due to the independence that the Sabaean kingdom maintained from the 8th century BC to AD275.

Naturally, with such an auspicious start, Cú Chulainn goes on to become a legendary figure in his own right.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_venetian_horse"	"The Veneti were considered to be excellent horse-breeders widely known for producing the strongest and fasters mares in ancient Italy. Venetic horses were greatly sought-after by the Greeks; they famously won the Olympic Games for Leon of Sparta in 440BC. Dionysius of Syracuse wanted to repeat this success himself, buying Venetian horses for a four-horse chariot race during the Olympic Games in 388BC. Diodorus of Sicily reported that several four-horse teams raced for Syracuse, and were far superior to the other contenders due to their swiftness. In Veneti society, Horses played an important role, as attested to by the horse cemeteries found around the ancient cities of Patavium, Altinum and Atria. Wild horses living on the slopes of the Alps were incorporated into domestic herds by the able Veneti horse-breeders, which enabled them to cultivate their stables and in turn, their reputation and social status. Several Venetic inscriptions mention the word 'ekuperatis', which means 'master of the horse' and perhaps refers to commerce, warfare, nobility, or all of the above."	"True"

They roamed this region as they pleased, and had a fierce reputation as cavalrymen almost without equal. They were feared by the Greeks, and often worked as mercenaries or allied themselves to the Dacians. The Sarmatians were always horse archers, but their cavalry gradually adopted heavier and heavier armour as the centuries passed, eventually wearing as much armour as the famed cataphracts of the east. Even the horses wore full suits of scale armour. The riders kept their fearsome bows even as they became magnificent shock cavalry.

They repelled multiple Roman advances, and even survived the sacking of their capital during the 1st century BC.

As in all warrior societies, the heaviest armour was reserved for use by the nobility of the tribes, and Saka nobility could be deadly indeed. As a people, they showed little inclination to bow to any outsider. In 512BC, King Darius the Great attempted to subdue the Saka, and marched into their steppe lands.  It did him little good. The tribes avoided open battle, and raided whenever and wherever they pleased. Alexander the Great, almost two centuries later, eventually lured the Saka into battle at Jaxartes in 329BC.

Womens' graves have also been found to contain spears, shields, and daggers, indicating that they may have fought alongside their men on the battlefield, rather than in a purely defensive capacity when their settlements were attacked. It was certainly common for women to have status and power within Germanic tribal society; they were able to inherit them following the death of their fathers or husbands, and could even demand divorce following an unsuccessful match. In common with the traditions of their Celtic neighbours, the opinion and judgement of Germanic priestesses and female elders was also highly respected by all."	"True"

Like the heavier-armed and armoured Triarii veterans they most likely supported, rorarii were the army's reserves, only to be used in dire emergencies where both the hastati and principes had begun to waver. This three-line approach was the standard Roman formation until Gaius Marius' extensive military reforms during the 1st century BC, in which each soldier became an all-purpose 'legionary', with standardised state-issued equipment, training, pay and pension quickly transforming the Romans into the state-of-the-art super-soldiers of the ancient world."

Worshipped throughout the tribes, known as Odin within Norse mythology and thought to be the equivalent of Mercury from the Roman pantheon, all-powerful Wodanaz inspired German warriors as the bringer of victory. It was he who stood in judgement over a conflict; he who would ultimately decide the victor. Any warrior who fell in battle automatically joined the war god’s own army. Wodanaz also carried a mighty spear, and those men with the strength and status to carry larger thrusting spears fought in his image. A German warrior would routinely call upon the gods in preparation for battle, his shield brought close to the mouth to amplify and deepen the sound, further intimidating the enemy."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_num_armoured_numidian_spearmen"	"Numidia had a fierce warrior tradition, partly because the eastern Massylii and western Masaesyli had a history of bitter feuding and internal warfare. They took, and changed, sides in the Punic Wars to suit their own agendas, only emerging as a single state after the cataclysmic Battle of Zama in 202BC. The defeat of Carthage allowed the Numidians to expand their lands, eventually leading to the Jugurthine War of 112-105BC against Rome. Numidia’s king, Jugurtha, was only defeated when he was betrayed by his father-in-law, Bocchus. While the Numidians were famed as cavalrymen, their infantry forces were also quite effective. The historian Suetonius mentions that there were Numidian 'legions', a term reserved for Roman troops, when passing comment on Julius Caesar’s speech regarding Juba’s march to aid Scipio before the Battle of Thapsus in 46BC. This suggests that some Numidians were fighting in the Roman style, and were possibly equipped in the same manner. The Numidians also adopted other tactics and war gear, such as the thureos-style shield and hoplite-like spears."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Cal_Highland_Archers"	"In the cold northern lands of Britannia, food was scarce and most physically-able Celts hunted for their tribe's chief source of sustenance. Using longbows mostly made of yew, they became proficient at trapping and ambushing their prey. Even though archery was considered cowardly within a way of battle that favoured the heroic (but often suicidal) charge above all else, when war came to the Celtic lands hunters did not abandon their ranged weapons. While not as strong as regular melee fighters, along the hills and within the dense forests, marksmen had the advantage against the slow-moving Roman Legions. This irregular, guerrilla warfare used by the Caledonii was particularly suited to highland archers, who picked off their targets before retreating into dense woodland where it was unlikely they would be followed."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_nab_armoured_desert_hoplites"	"The Nabataeans, although in dire relations with the Seleucids, borrowed many Hellenistic practices. As their empire expanded, the Seleucids tried to fold many nearby territories into it, looking to put a hand on the lucrative trade routes of southern Arabia as well. In the numerous military engagements between the two states, the Nabataeans developed the need to copy the greater disciplined, better structured Hellenistic way of fighting. They also used captured gear and although they were bitter rivals, admired the Greeks for their culture and civilisation. Most famous of these encounters are the Antigonid–Nabataean confrontations in 312BC. In the first instance, Antigonus appointed one of his officers, Athenaeus to pillage Petra. He did so successfully, as the defenders were away trading during the night of the raid. Not only was their stock captured, but also families, to be traded as slaves. However, the Nabataeans quickly realised the situation and were able to hunt down the 4,600-strong army and almost wipe it out, with only a few dozen escaping. Athenaeus was not among the survivors."

Having splintered from the migrating Celts following Brennus’ invasions of Macedon and Greece in 279BC, three tribes, the Tectosages, Tolistobogii and Trocmi, moved through Thrace and crossed the Bosporus into Asia Minor. They came as allies of Nicomedes of Bithynia and secured a victory for him in a dynastic struggle against his brother. After a brief and inconclusive war between Nicomedes and the Seleucid king, Antiochus, the Galatians settled down to stay. Their territory was split between the three tribes, each maintaining its own capital, but with a council at Drynemeton, a sacred grove of oaks near the Tectosages’ capital at Ancyra. Ruled by a military aristocracy, the Galatians left the indigenous Cappadocian people in control of their own towns and lands in return for tithes. Galatian mercenaries were highly prized and respected by Greek, Roman and Seleucid commanders. In fact, the personal bodyguard of the Ptolemies of Egypt consisted of Celtic mercenaries, and it is highly likely that these men came from Galatia."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Afr_Tribal_Slingers_Long"	"Slingers were common in ancient armies. Slings are ancient weapons, dating back to Palaeolithic times. In comparison to bows, they were easy to make and had a greater effective range. Constructed from braided flax, hemp or rushes, a sling has a cradle where the shot is placed. One end has a finger-loop, while the other has a knot or strip giving a firm handhold. The slinger puts his middle finger through the loop and holds the knotted end with his thumb and forefinger. After whirling the shot in the sling it is released with a flick of the wrist. Quick to fire and reload, the sling was widely hated by those on the receiving end. Shot varied from stones collected in rivers to shaped lumps of clay and lead; lead shot could fly over 400 metres. Such missiles were sometimes inscribed with comments such as “Catch!” or “Take that!” Shot was difficult to see in flight, and although it lacked the penetrating power of an arrow it could easily break bone or stave-in armour at short ranges. Famously, the Roman Consul Paulus was killed by a slinger early in the disastrous Battle of Cannae."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Praetorian_Cav_Long"	"The word 'praetorian' comes from the elite guards of the Praetor, the commanding general. Founded in the 6th century BC, the cohors praetoria consisted of the hand-picked infantry or cavalry who guarded their general and his command tent. At first, they were recruited exclusively from among Roman citizens, but later other Latin peoples were allowed to join. The praetorians enjoyed prestigious status in the Roman army and, when Augustus came to power, they were the only soldiers allowed inside Rome. Augustus anticipated that they could be used politically as well as militarily, something of a gamble for the new Emperor, as he was keen to assert the Republican nature of his regime. Barracked just outside Rome, the praetorians were charged with keeping order during all public events. Later, as the Imperial bodyguard, they served in military campaigns only when the Emperor himself was present. This happened frequently as later Emperors emerged from the ranks of the army during the 1st century AD."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Celtic_Levy"	"Levies could be quickly mustered, outfitted and turned into an army, whether citizens or subjects. Usually commanded by nobles or local dignitaries, levies supplemented the elite professional soldiers; the king would order his subordinates to muster troops and gather at an appointed time and place. These noblemen brought their households, attendant warriors, and levies. Over time there was a gradual move away from citizen and subject recruits to professional standing armies and a greater use of mercenaries. Both classes were formerly levies who saw warfare as a career rather than a duty. In turn, this opened the way for promotion on merit rather than birth, creating armies loyal to generals rather than the old social order."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Aux_Thracian_Generic"	"There were some forty tribes of Thracians, who shared a common language and culture and inhabited a vast area north of the Greek lands. They were seen as war-loving, rebellious, rambunctious, and bad enemies, yet good allies in a fight. Many leaders dreaded a time when the Thracians would be united under a single leader and sweep southwards. Such a turn of events never happened, but Thracians could be found across much of the European world fighting as mercenaries, often specialising as skirmishers and light troops. The forward curving rhomphaia, with its razor-sharp blade and long handle, could lop off limbs in the hands of a skilled user, and Thracians were certainly skilled in its use. The most famous Thracian 'general' of all never actually fought an action in Thrace or in command of a Thracian army; he was Spartacus, the commander of the last great slave rebellion against Rome between 73 and 71 BC."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Aux_Numidian_Cavalry"	"Numidian tribesmen were raised with horses from an early age, riding bareback without a bridle and controlling their horses by tapping the beasts between the ears with a stick. Numidian cavalry were supremely agile, skirmishing with assured expertise before swinging around to escape as rapidly as they had arrived. Wearing only a thin tunic, they carried javelins and small wicker shields. Their horses, ancestors of the Berber horse, were small and well adapted for speed over long distances. Harassing tactics, while rarely decisive, were extremely frustrating to less mobile enemies, but not so useful against heavier types of cavalry. Described as "by far the best horsemen in Africa" by the historian Livy, their strength was recognised by Rome as a great military asset."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Rom_Legionary_Cavalry"	"By recruiting horsemen from Iberia, Gaul, Numidia and Thrace, Roman cavalry adapted to accommodate the army's changing needs and resources. Each Legion originally included 300 equites and 600 to 900 socii, so a typical consular army fielded between 1800 and 2400 horsemen. However, in order to cope with the demands of a growing empire, there was a gradual shift away towards using cavalry from outside the Italian peninsular. As equites became legionary officers and the socii citizens, cavalry recruits from Italy became scarce. By the time of Caesar’s Gallic campaigns the Legions relied almost exclusively on allied cavalry. Equipment changed little during this period; the spear and chainmail adopted by the equites, and probably influenced by the Celts, came full-circle with the recruitment of Gallic cavalry. Nevertheless, helmet and shield styles changed and the small, round shield of the equites, via the Galatians of Asia Minor, gradually became the versatile 'thureos'."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Polybolos_Long"	"The polybolos was a repeating bolt thrower developed from the ballista and scorpion. A chain mechanism drew, loaded and released bolts from a gravity-fed magazine as quickly as a handle could be turned. Supposedly invented by Dionysius of Alexandria, the polybolos was quite a complex machine: as the operator turned a windlass handle, the bow was tensioned as a launching shuttle pulled back, an arrow dropped into place, and finally a catch was released to fire the machine. The process repeated as long as the operator worked. All he needed was a loader to keep the magazine filled. Efficient and deadly, the polybolos had the greatest rate of fire of all ancient war machines."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Gallo_Thracian_Long"	"In the century following their settlement at Tylis in northern Thrace, the remnants of Brennus' great Celtic migration did more than simply raid and pillage the surrounding territories. Over the years, a natural absorption of cultural ideas and military techniques occurred due to the Celts' close proximity to their Thracian neighbours. Inevitably, this process was strengthened by inter-marriage, eventually producing a new generation of Gallo-Thracian warriors. These men, the product of two such distinct martial cultures, were steeped in the best elements of each. As such, they fought as heroic swordsmen in the Celtic tradition, yet were instilled with the stealth and swift-footedness of the finest Thracian skirmishers. This combination of strengths ensured that to face the Gallo-Thracians in battle was an extremely dangerous proposition for any would-be foe."	"True"

They, along with other Iberians, presented a distinct and unpleasant challenge to Roman arms; Lusitani were even present among Hannibal’s ranks at the Battle of Cannae in 216BC. During the Roman incursions into Iberia between 155-139BC the Lusitani resisted, particularly once they had been lied to by, and subsequently massacred on the orders of, Servius Sulpicius Galba, the Praetor of Rome’s Iberian forces. He had convinced the Lusitani to give up their arms, and then had them slaughtered by his Legions. Seeking revenge, the Lusitani went on to fight a bitter guerrilla war against the invaders."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ill_Tribesmen_Long"	"Although called Illyrians by Greeks and Romans, these seafaring people from the Adriatic coast were actually not a single nation or tribe. The Greeks first had dealings with them during the Bronze Age, and the name was then applied to everyone in the area. The Illyrians were actually several petty, and not-so-petty, kingdoms that warred with each other when not fighting Greeks or their Macedonian neighbours. The Illyrians could not be lightly dismissed as barbarians: under powerful warlords such as Bardyllis, king of the Dardanians, they conquered Macedon and installed a puppet ruler in 393BC. It was Phillip II and Alexander the Great who eventually ended Illyrian interference in their affairs. The Illyrians were also pirates, and terrorised the Adriatic for centuries; this was what eventually prompted their subjugation by the Romans."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Tribesmen_Long"	"Like many warriors, Iberian tribesmen were stubborn beyond all reason in defence of their gods, homes, lands and honour. Even when cornered, surrounded and beyond all hope, defeat was not an idea that could be entertained for a moment. In fact, rather than accept the shame of defeat they were known to kill themselves. Possibly they also hoped to deny the enemy the glory of having killed them. Some warriors went into battle carrying vials of quick-acting poison, carefully extracted from a variety of buttercup. All Strabo, the Greek historian described the poison as “…a herb that is nearly like parsley and painless…”, he was not being terribly accurate. Like all poisons, it hurt, and it caused the user’s face to contort into a horrid, sardonic grin before death came. This morbid, mocking expression unnerved enemies, even Romans, who were convinced that the smiling corpses were mocking their foes from the afterlife."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_hippotoxotes"	"The Greco-Persian wars were a series of conflicts between Achaemenid Persia and the Greek city-states, starting in 499BC and enduring for the next half-century. The battles between these powers saw the clash of Greek-style phalanxes and supporting troops against the diverse Persian army, which had mastered the bow, using it to great effect both on foot and on horseback. After the war against the Persians ended, Greek generals would have been fools not to acknowledge the effectiveness of mounted archers, which could attack and quickly retreat, and were impossible for hoplites to catch up with. As Athens' cavalry corps grew in numbers, a two hundred-strong body of hippotoxotes (horse archers) were fielded to support the main army. According to Xenophon, they even led the cavalry charge, riding ahead to soften up the enemy before retreating behind the main lines."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Scythed_Chariots_Long"	"Heavy scythed chariots developed during the Greco-Persian Wars as a response to armoured infantry and the phalanx. Although many cultures used them, the original idea was probably Persian or Indian. Others took up the idea, and Mithridates VI of Pontus had some success using scythed chariots against Bithynia during the Battle of the River Amnias in 89BC, at the start of the First Mithridatic War. They relied on their momentum and axle-mounted blades to break enemy lines, creating weak points to be exploited by cavalry. Even if the chariot horses instinctively veered off at the last moment, the long axle blades would carve an opening. If any still stood, there was a good chance confusion and panic in the survivors would set in. Both the horses and drivers eventually had quite heavy armour, reminiscent of later cataphract cavalry.

However, the introduction of the long sarissa countered their effectiveness somewhat better."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Gal_Longsword_Cohort"	"The two-handed longsword was the Celtic weapon of choice. Many Roman soldiers had their shields and armour split in half by a barbaric swing of Celtic iron. Not every warrior could wield this weapon, however - a young freeman had to prove himself in battle before he was given a longsword, as such items were status symbols due to the cost of producing them. Having a closer relationship with the local tribes, Gallic Rome's military started equipping regular Roman soldiers with these blades, creating a new type of powerful infantry unit. Although never used in a traditional battleline, these warriors brought a particular mix of barbaric strength and civilised organisation to combat."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Archers_Long"	"Eastern archers could inflict heavy casualties when used in large numbers, and their composite bows gave them a good range, accuracy and penetrating power. The composite bow was, as its name suggests, made from many materials, and its layers of wood, sinew and animal horn made it a very effective energy-storing spring. In the hands of a reasonable bowman, an arrow from a composite bow would go through chainmail at respectable ranges. It did not, however, take kindly to getting wet. The glues used in its construction soon broke down in damp conditions. In the deserts of the east this was hardly a problem, but it does explain why the composite bow was never adopted in Europe."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_umbri_tribe"	"The Umbri were an ancient mountain tribe from small, hilltop settlements along the central Apennines. Roman writers considered them to be more Gallic than Italic, but the Umbri's contact with the neighbouring Etruscan cities brought them closer to civilisation in their habits and level of technology. The Gallic newcomers and some ambitious Etruscan campaigns eventually forced the Umbri to migrate southward. According to Pliny the Elder, the Etruscans conquered three hundred Umbrian towns along their eastern border. Despite this loss of territory, the Umbri seem to have thrived, founding a number of settlements on high hills, which were naturally easy to defend and difficult to assault. Umbrians were never as aggressive as any of the neighbouring tribes, but nonetheless survived multiple invasions until their final absorption into the Roman Republic in 260BC."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Egy_Sobek_Cultists_Long"	"Defender of the Nile and protector of Pharaoh's power, Sobek was the crocodile-headed god of ancient Egypt from the Old Kingdom period through to the Ptolemaic dynasty and beyond. As such, crocodiles were venerated for their violent, primal qualities, and were even bred on temple sites as a living personifications of the god, and mummified when they died. This was especially the case in the fertile Faiyum region and the cities of Kom Ombo, Shedet and Krokodilopolis, where many mummified specimens of adults and babies, as well as eggs, have since been found. At some point in his history, Sobek became associated with Osiris, Isis, Horus, and  Ra, adding healing, solar, and protective aspects to his primitive aggression, using this connection to ward off evil and protect the people of Egypt in the same, surprisingly tender, manner that crocodiles care for their young. With titles such as 'One who buries of the bodies of the crocodile-gods of the Land of the Lake' and 'prophet of the crocodile-gods', the priests of the cult of Sobek served him completely in the main temple at Shedet in defence of the Pharaoh and his subjects."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Garrison_Spear_Long"	"These spearmen were drawn from the subjects of the eastern regions. They were inexpensive, and simply equipped with a spear, wicker shield and cloth armour. Their shields were oval or rectangular in shape with a central handgrip. While uniformly equipped for the most part, their appearance varied greatly depending where they were recruited, and all kinds of Greek and Persian influences were manifest. In battle, spearmen guarded the flanks of phalanxes, or provided protection for skirmishers and archers. Although ill-equipped to face heavy enemies, their numbers and spears made them an effective counter to unarmoured cavalry. They were also a common type of mercenary and levied unit throughout Asia Minor and the Middle East."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Citizen_Hoplites_Long"	"Hoplites date back to the wars between the Greek city-states in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. During the Greco-Persian Wars most hoplites wore a Corinthian-style bronze helm, and a cuirass of bronze or stiffened linen or canvas. They were armed with a short sword and an iron-tipped spear with a bronze counterbalance butt-spike. Hoplites were named, though, after the round hoplon shield they carried. The hoplon-and-spear combination required them to fight as a phalanx, a block of spearmen some eight ranks deep. When closed up, each man would find shelter behind the shield of his neighbour, creating a wall of bristling spear-points. While all hoplites were originally citizen-soldiers, full-time mercenaries took over and became the standard fighting unit of the Greek world. Later, under Phillip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great, the shield became smaller, while the spear developed into the five metre sarissa pike. Many armies adopted the phalanx of hoplites as a tactical unit because it was very successful in battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Bac_Hillmen_Long"	"The Bactrian plain is to the west of the Hindu Kush in what is now Afghanistan. It first enters records of antiquity through Ctesias, a Greek historian (circa 400BC), who falsely claimed that the Assyrian King Ninus defeated the Bactrians in 2140BC. A fertile and developed land, Bactria was prosperous and so, during the expansion of the Achaemenid Empire, it inevitably drew the interest of the newly crowned Cyrus the Great. Under the Achaemenids, Bactria enjoyed the special privilege of being ruled by the crown prince, or heir-apparent to the royal line. It has been suggested that before the Persians, however, Bactria was ruled by the Median Kingdom before they, too, fell to the expansionist Achaemenids. Like many other Persian satrapies, Bactria attempted to rebel against its overlords in the wake of Darius III's defeat by Alexander the Great, only to be subdued by the victorious general."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Dac_Falxmen_Long"	"The exact origins of the Dacians are something of a mystery. Dacian lands were centred around the Carpathian Mountains but, unlike their Thracian neighbours, they seldom got involved in the conflicts of others. The Dacians fought almost entirely on foot, and usually looked to their Sarmatian allies when serious cavalry were needed. Many Dacian infantry fought as peltasts, equipped with javelins, short swords and oval shields, but they also fielded archers. However, the Dacians were most feared because of a weapon called the 'falx', which they used with deadly, limb-lopping skill. A two-handed sword with a forward-curving blade, a falx could cut a man in two from the top of his head to his breastbone. This weapon was so effective that the Romans improved their legionary armour to cope with it. The brow-ridge on later legionary helmets was there to stop a blow from a falx. Rome’s eventual victory in the Dacian Wars (AD101-106), celebrated by Trajan’s Column, finally dealt with the warlike Dacian tribes once and for all."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Ala_Alani_Swordsmen"	"Alani warriors were known to be strong and fierce - the Roman historian Marcellinus spoke of them in complimentary terms, calling them "men of great stature and beauty" with "terribly fierce" eyes. Their hardiness and determination is hardly surprising, given their lives on the harsh, eastern steppes, and then having to cope with upheaval and westward migration brought on by the appearance of the Huns. The Alans, Sarmatians and indeed all the nomadic tribes, had no choice but to master this unforgiving life or be destroyed or consumed by a stronger people. They dominated the Pontic steppes until the Gothic tribes spread south-eastward into their lands. The subsequent encounter had a significant influence on Gothic culture, with the Germanic people developing into exceptional horsemen in their own right."	"True"

The defeat of Carthage allowed the Numidians to expand their lands, eventually leading to the Jugurthine War of 112-105BC against Rome. Numidia’s king, Jugurtha, was only defeated when he was betrayed by his father-in-law, Bocchus. While the Numidians were famed as cavalrymen, their infantry forces were also quite effective. The historian Suetonius mentions that there were Numidian 'legions', a term reserved for Roman troops, when passing comment on Julius Caesar’s speech regarding Juba’s march to aid Scipio before the Battle of Thapsus in 46BC.

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_latin_tribe"	"Long before the Romans became a continent-spanning superpower, they were a small tribe of Latin origin living between the River Tiber and the ridge of Mount Circeo. They were not the only Latin peoples living there - the entire region was populated by city-states who maintained close cultural and religious ties, sharing festivals such as Feriae Latinae. Rome itself became a city around 625BC, when a group of separate settlements from various hills joined together. At that time, the dominating culture in the region was Etruscan, from which the Romans adapted many of their beliefs, rituals, and military traditions. As Rome grew larger to encompass more and more local tribes, so too grew its army, from a founding force of around three thousand infantry supported by three hundred horsemen, to the imposing, world-beating Legions of the Roman Empire. Social class dictated the army's quality, as each warrior brought their own equipment and the poorest were excluded due to poor-quality weapons and non-existent armour. However, citizens considered military service a duty to the state, meaning that Latin warriors were never in short supply."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_General_Long"	"Rome’s Consuls were Republican politicians and generals in equal measure. Every year two Consuls were elected by the Senate, each with the power to veto the other, a system designed to stop tyranny and the abuse of power. In civil matters the Consuls led the Senate, alternating on a monthly basis. Where military matters were concerned, their power outside the walls of Rome was absolute, with each commanding an army. When a combined Consular force was in the field, as at the Battle of Cannae in 216BC against Hannibal, the Consuls Lucius Paullus and Gaius Varro had to alternate command on a daily basis. This had disastrous consequences, as the impetuous Varro led so many of his numerically superior army to their deaths. In the Roman world, absolute power meant final responsibility, and defeat was entirely the commanding Consul’s fault. In these cases, punishment could be severe, as during the Numantine War, of 154-152BC, when Gaius Mancinus’ apparent cowardice led to the capture of his Legions. Although Tiberius Gracchus, then a military Tribune, secured their release through treaty, the Senate refused to recognise it and sent Mancinus straight back to the enemy! Even when successful, a Consul was accountable for his actions towards the provinces, allies and resources at his command. When Scipio returned from the Punic Wars, he was hailed as 'Imperator', granted a triumph and given the honorific title ‘Africanus’, but he was nevertheless accused of squandering money by the Senate, albeit at the urging of his enemy, Cato."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_roman_two"	"The waterline ram was first mounted on a vessel in around 850BC. Warships and naval tactics were transformed. Ships were no longer platforms for infantry battles on the water; the ship itself became the weapon. Galleys changed as the new reality sank in. Ramming at speed would hole and sink an enemy, therefore slimmer, faster, handier ships were required. More speed on demand obviously required more oars a fast ship with a single row of oars ended up being stupidly, impractically long. The solution, then, was to put in a second set of oars above the first, but slightly offset to allow for rowers' benches. These biremes, a Latin word meaning 'two oars', or dieres, the Greek equivalent, were no longer than previous designs but had twice the number of rowers. They were fast, manoeuvrable, and could carry a fighting contingent. Some nations also gave their bireme crews fire pots; these clay pots filled with oil and pitch were hurled at enemy ships in the entirely reasonable hope of setting them ablaze."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Pel_Immortals_Long"	"The 'Ten Thousand Immortals' were a military force of elite infantry divisions within the Achaemenid Empire, acting as both an imperial guard and an expeditionary army during the Persian conquests. They were so named for always numbering exactly ten thousand - if any man died or fell ill, he was immediately replaced; in this way the unit never 'died'. Herodotus describes them as “magnificently” equipped, glittering in gold and dressed in the finest armour. The Immortals were also afforded the best food and treatment befitting of their elite status. They famously fought at the Battle of Thermopylae, outflanking the redoubtable Spartans and ultimately securing victory. Although the unit died with the Achaemenids, it was revived much later under the Sassanids, helping to legitimise Sassanid rule as inheritors of Persian power."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Tribesmen_Long"	"In his heart of hearts, the German tribesman was a warrior and only a warrior. When not fighting, he was seeking out another fight. Only in battle could a man earn the glory and wealth needed to improve his position within the tribe. This was not an easy life, and only the toughest lived idly away from the battlefield. Others had to work, toiling in the fields and forests, awaiting glory that could be won in battle or by raiding against the tribe's enemies."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Goth_Gothic_Falxmen"	"A Germanic people consisting of several confederated tribes, it is thought that the Goths came from the Baltic coast region of northern Poland, possibly incorporating land as far afield as Sweden. They began to appear on the fringes of the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, their migration possibly forced by overpopulation and climate changes during the Dark Ages that made agriculture difficult in their homelands. Descending into the Balkan Peninsula via Dacia and Greece, they sacked several prominent cities in the region and probably destroyed the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Gothic aggression was eventually checked by the Emperor Claudius II; a deal was struck which allowed them to remain settled on the borders of Rome's empire, in Dacia, in return for military assistance as auxiliaries and foederati. This state of affairs persisted for quite some time, with the Goths converting to Arian Christianity, and even becoming somewhat Romanised in the intervening years."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_rom_centuriae"	"Romulus himself is said to have raised ten 'centuriae', consisting of one hundred men from among the founding tribes of Rome. The centuriae consisted of ten 'contubernias' of ten men each. A century was commanded by a centurion assisted by an 'optio' (lieutenant) and 'tesserarius' (sergeant). Each one had a banner or signum carried by a 'signifer'. Also, each century provided a 'buccinator', who played a kind of horn used to send orders corresponding to a particular sound. Unlike the Greeks and other defensive martial cultures, Rome's army was encouraged to act brutally, even massacring captives and civilians to prove Roman supremacy in warfare. Army leaders often granted 'freedom' following a battle, even allowing their soldiers to rape and pillage when on foreign soil, mimicking Romulus himself, who killed his brother Remus and organised the infamous 'Rape of the Sabine Women' and massacre of their husbands."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Equites_Catafractarii"	"Having faced the deadly Parthian cataphracts at Carrhae, come off worse, and then struggled against the awesome crushing strength of the Sarmatian lancers, it wasn't long before the Roman army was tailoring its own cavalry to match, despite resisting the idea for some time. Gradually, Rome began to integrate its own versions, the catafractarii and clibinarii, into the Legions. They were probably first fielded during the reign of the Emperor Hadrian, as an auxiliary force of Gauls and Pannonians. However, despite their general success, it was the 4th century AD before catafractarii became a permanent addition to the ranks, possibly due to Macrinus' catastrophic defeat at Nisibis in AD217, by the Parthians. Covered head-to-foot in scale or mail armour, and armed with lances, it is clear that the 'iron horsemen' were the forerunners to the more familiar knights of the Medieval age."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Rom_Praetorian_Guard"	"The word 'praetorian' comes from the elite guards of the praetor, the commanding general. Founded in the 6th century BC, the original 'Cohors Praetoria' consisted of the hand-picked infantry or cavalry who guarded the general's tent. At first, they were recruited exclusively from among Roman citizens, but later other Latin peoples were also permitted to join. The praetorians enjoyed prestigious status in the Roman army and, when Augustus came to power, were the only soldiers allowed inside the walls of Rome itself. Due to their presence and proximity to the Emperor, these high-status troops could be used politically as well as militarily. Barracked just outside Rome, the praetorians were charged with keeping order during public events. As the Imperial bodyguard, they served in military campaigns only when the Emperor himself was present. This happened frequently as later Emperors emerged from the ranks of the army during the crisis that followed the death of Alexander Severus."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ill_Marines_Long"	"The Illyrian aristocracy advocated raiding for profit, leading to  widespread piracy in the Adriatic for several centuries. Over the years, the Illyrians became formidable pirates who struck fear into many a trade ship captain’s heart. Attacks by Illyrian pirates on merchant shipping eventually prompted Roman intervention in the region, and later its total absorption into their growing empire. Like many 'barbarian' peoples, the Illyrians were fearsome fighters who frequently displayed suicidal bravery. Their natural, warlike temperament, along with a fine, long-standing seafaring tradition, made them well-suited to raiding and piracy. Marines were elite melee troops highly skilled in seaborne combat, where the ability to keep upright and balanced whilst fighting hand-to-hand was paramount."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Pel_Marines_Long"	"Naval warfare in the ancient world was just another way for infantry to fight one another. The earliest documented naval battles are those of ancient China, 'grapple and hook' battles where boarding operations and close-quarters combat decided the victor. During the Second Punic War, Rome famously broke Carthage's mastery of the waves by creating the 'corvus' - a bridge that allowed its soldiers to board and fight. The distinction, then, in antiquity, between fighting on land and at sea was small, yet chiefly a matter of 'sea legs' - maintaining balance whilst toppling your opponent. Hoplites therefore appeared on Greek ships, and not just as passengers, which allowed Greek armies to pursue operations further afield with greater flexibility."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Afr_Tribesmen_Long"	"Drawn from a vast area and numerous tribes, the warriors of sub-Saharan Africa were unsurprisingly diverse in appearance and culture. They all possessed long and rich warrior traditions, such as the Numidians, the Nubians and their descendants who ruled Kush, and Aksum. Despite tribal differences, weapons and equipment differed only in detail: spears, javelins, bows and short swords were favoured. Relatively little armour was worn, but some tribes did employ wicker, wood or hide shields. Adornments and decorations varied greatly and some groups sported war paint. Aethiopians in Persian service were known for painting themselves chalk white on one side and vermillion on the other, and using spears and bows of palmwood. Fighting as allies and mercenaries for Carthage, Persia, and the eastern Successors, tribesmen could be found throughout Africa and Asia Minor."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Car_Noble_Cav_Long"	"Carthaginian citizens were rarely called to military service because their armies were mostly legions of mercenaries and levied troops. Only men from the wealthiest and most powerful families, such as Hannibal Barca and his brothers, got the opportunity to serve. The army was, in many ways, their family’s private army rather than belonging to Carthage. Modelled after Macedon’s revered Companion cavalry, the noble horsemen of Carthage were a drilled and disciplined force that rode the finest African and Spanish horses. In the 3rd century BC they were rightly considered to be amongst some of the finest heavy cavalry in the world."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Pal_Palmyrene_Cohort"	"As Rome fell into its greatest crisis to date during the 3rd century AD, the client state of Palmyra had grown autonomous and ambitious, launching independent military efforts against nearby enemies such as the Sassanids. As Queen Zenobia marched into Roman lands, claiming them for herself, the resulting Palmyrene Empire encompassed the wealthiest eastern provinces of Rome. As the Mesopotamian border was already heavily fortified against the Persian threat, Palmyra's soldiers were well trained and equipped, coming from the rich families of Syria, Palastynia and Aegyptus. The eastern armies Zenobia commanded took innovation from the local military traditions, using cataphractarii, horse archers, camels and Iranian-style infantry. Her legions were also much more resistant to weather conditions as its conscripts were used to the oppressive desert heat."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Afr_Elephants_Long"	"The now-extinct African forest elephants were smaller than the Indian variety. At around two to two and a half metres in height, they were an imposing beast capable of causing panic in enemies unused to facing them in battle. Having fought Syracusan elephants in Sicily in 278-6BC, the Carthaginians captured and tamed the local elephants rather than importing larger specimens from India. The Carthaginians did, however, hire Indian experts to form the most powerful elephant corps of the period. At Bagradas River in 255BC, the Carthaginian elephants caused many casualties, leaving the Romans fearful of battling the creatures for many years afterwards."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_ara_desert_levy"	"Throughout the civilised world, levies formed the backbone of many armies. Called to service from among citizens or subjects, they followed a long tradition that began, in Greece at least, with hoplite warfare between the city-states. Equipped with spears, these levied phalanxes could present a formidable wall of spear points to other infantry and cavalry. What levies lacked in skill and discipline compared to professional soldiers and mercenaries, they made up for in numbers and the advantage their weaponry provided. These troops, especially the citizen-levy of the Greek city-states, were at first expected to provide their own arms and equipment. As time passed, the citizen army developed into a more formalised body in which arms and equipment were provided. Often, however, personal loyalty to a general or king replaced any sense of civic duty, although 'civic duty' might be grudging to say the least in men taken from their homes, families and livelihoods, and thrust into battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Camel_Cataphracts_Long"	"The camel is a curious thing in battle and, when clad in full armour, its strange looks are  much enhanced. Camels are also rather smelly, and this makes horses uneasy unless they are used to the odour. Perhaps not the fastest of creatures, the camel does not charge particularly quickly, but the extra height it gives to its rider makes a lance rather effective. The word 'cataphract' derives from two Greek words, 'kata' - completely - and 'phraktos' - covered or protected. This neatly describes the all-over nature of the armour of both man and camel. Cataphracts were even adopted by the Romans, who used them in their Eastern Empire as auxiliaries."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_aequi_tribe"	"The Aequi were an ancient Italic mountain tribe from an area within the Apennine mountains to the east of Rome. They predate the existence of the Romans, according to Strabo, and are first mentioned by Livy as the people from which Rome borrowed the formal act of declaring war. Several wars were fought between Roman and Aequi forces, with the first conflict occurring in 494BC, when their invasion of Latium was launched at the same time as the first secession by the plebs. As the Roman army advanced, the Aequi retreated from their newly-occupied territory and set up camp in the mountains, which they knew well. Rome's consul considered that an attack would have little chance of success, as the enemy's position was difficult to approach, but in the end the troops took matters into their own hands, advancing up the hill towards the Aequian camp. The Aequi were so stunned at the enemy's boldness that they abandoned their camp, relinquishing an abundance of booty to the Roman army. Numerous conflicts erupted between the city of Rome and the Aequi following that cowardly retreat, though neither side conquered significant territories until Rome's rise to power in the 3rd century BC."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Equites_Long"	"Recruited from the gentry and lower aristocratic classes of Roman society, the equites were the cavalrymen of the royal and early Republican Roman armies. To be a member of the equestrian class meant that a man was rich enough to keep a horse, and provide his own armour, shield and spear. There were usually some 300 equites in each Republican Legion, organised into ten turmae of thirty horsemen each under the command of three decuriones. One of these men would be the praefectus, or commander, of the squadron. Mostly drawn from the young sons of elite society, these were men keen to show their courage. Showing prowess on the battlefield was an important step towards gaining political office and prestige for their families. Mundane duties such as patrol or reconnaissance would be the work of the equites extraordinarii of the Socii, the Romans’ collected Italian allies. During the Samnite and Punic Wars, the equites’ ranks were opened to first class commoners. Although they received none of the equestrians' social and political powers, they eventually replaced the aristocracy in the ranks of the Roman cavalry, allowing the equestrians to become senior officers in the newer Marian Legions."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_saba_mer_himyar_cavalry"	"The Arabian Peninsula was not a state, but a land occupied by inter-related tribes and powerful families. The nomadic Bedouin raised sheep and traded goods across the desert, while farmers were settled around the oases. The camel helped the nomadic tribes to grow in power, and the variety among the tribes produced many different fighting styles, but infantry nevertheless remained important in Arab armies. Although unarmoured slingers were fast and effective skirmishers, and Arabs also prided themselves on their close-combat skills. Traditionally, they fought as raiders looking for loot rather than conquest. Raids or 'razzias' brought honour to the victors, as well as the spoils of livestock and goods for their tribes. Conflicts were usually small in scale and casualties were largely avoided, as a fighting retreat in the face of great odds was not considered shameful. After the conquest of Egypt, Rome had to cross the Arabian Peninsula in order to secure the lucrative trade with India, but the Romans never fully conquered the desert or the desert peoples."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Bri_Farmers_Long"	"Although farmers were lightly equipped as warriors, they came from a culture that had a long tradition of heroic warfare, raiding and skirmishing. Armed with spears and javelins, protected by cloth armour and Celtic, sub-rectangular La Tene shields, they made up for a lack of experience with numbers. Their weapons represented what was available to the common farmer, one who also fed his family by hunting."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Ger_Ambushers"	"Due to its sound logical reasoning, the ambush is one of the most ancient tactics, and remains so. Essentially, a surprised enemy, and one who is hopefully surrounded at the time, can be defeated more swiftly and easily. Learned on the hunt, the skills needed to successfully ambush were first tested by early man against the beasts he hunted for food. For the wise military commander, any forest or mountain pass presented an opportunity to lay ambush or, if not scouted and traversed with sufficient care, to be ambushed. Some of the most famous ambushes in history demonstrate the form's devastating potential, such as Arminius' resounding victory at Teutoburg Forest, where his men descended from the woodland to cut three Roman Legions to pieces. The Germans sprang the attack when the Romans were on the march and exposed, out of their fortified camp in a pounding rainstorm. Their subsequent victory restricted Roman expansion in western Europe, establishing the Rhine as a boundary between 'civilised' and tribal territory."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Naked_Warriors_Long"	"A Celtic warrior, with battle-lust in his heart, was an intimidating sight. A warrior who went into battle naked, sure of the protection of his gods, only compounded the unease felt by a foe.  Fighting naked was not a particularly original idea or, indeed, all that silly. It was quite practical, because dirty cloth could be forced into wounds causing all kinds of fatal infections. The Romans assumed it granted greater mobility. Celtic warriors, such as the Gaesatae, embraced the idea of fighting naked with gusto: both the Britons and Gauls were convinced of their own battle prowess. They also had absolute faith in Camulus, the god of war. A blessed warrior simply didn't need clothes."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Longbow_Hunters_Long"	"The German warrior was exposed on an open, flat battlefield but, when fighting in hills and woodland, he had the advantage. Most were raised as hunters in dense forests, so became expert at stealthy manoeuvres and laying ambush. Whilst their battle tactics were proven, their longbows, often two metres in length and made of yew, lacked the power and accuracy of composite bows made in the east. Their ammunition was also somewhat lacking: limited iron supplies meant these men often fired bone-tipped arrows that struggled to pierce enemy armour. On the battlefield, archers lined up behind slingers - afforded some protection by the shields of the warriors in front of them."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Rorarii_Long"	"“Rem ad Triarios redisse” or “going to the Triarii” was a Latin saying meaning to fight to the bitter end. The veteran triarii were the third line of battle behind the hastati and principes, and only fought when defeat looked likely. However, this saying excludes the supernumerary ranks of the rorarii, who stood even behind the triarii and were, when deployed, the very, very last line of defence. There is much debate over their actual role because historical detail is limited but the rorarii were light infantry armed with spears and shields. They are likely to have been a skirmisher reserve, missile support for the heavier infantry or perhaps rushed to fill any gaps that appeared in the line of triarii. It is thought the rorarii came from the poorest Romans, and were young men of little experience. They may even have been a last remnant of the old Roman phalanx-style army. During the Second Punic War, the rorarii were replaced by velites."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Cel_Celtic_Warhounds_Long"	"Dogs have always been useful for guard, patrol and scout work. With skilled handlers they can also be used effectively on the battlefield. Attack dogs were specifically bred and trained to ignore the noise and chaos of combat. Taught to attack on command, they were starved a little to ensure aggression before being unleashed upon enemy formations as a savage wave. Faced with a pack of foaming, hungry dogs many men naturally broke or faltered, opening gaps in a battle line that could then be exploited by melee troops."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Cappadocian_Cav_Long"	"Cappadocian horsemen could be found in many armies of Asia Minor, but were most common in the forces of Pontus and Armenia. Although the riders had scale armour and open helmets, so as not to impair their vision, their horses were unarmoured, allowing them a good degree of speed and manoeuvrability. They were certainly faster across ground than the heavy cataphracts used by eastern armies. These horsemen were most often placed on the flanks of an army to counter any enemy infantry skirmishers or light horse. Charges into spear or pike-armed phalanxes would have been stupid, and fatal. At the Battle of Gaugamela in 331BC, Cappadocian cavalry overwhelmed Alexander’s Asian and Greek mercenary cavalry, only to be halted by the Thessalians."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Colchian_Nobles_Long"	"Although the etymology of Colchis’ population is uncertain, the Greek historian Herodotus thought the kingdom was formed as an Egyptian colony in the 13th century BC. He therefore considered its inhabitants to be descended from both Egyptian colonists and the native Scythians, prior to the arrival of Greek traders around the 6th century BC. Over time, as Greek trading posts became cities, the ‘native’ population were largely subsumed by their culture, becoming uniquely ‘Colchian’. Eventually, its distance from the Greek homelands meant Colchis broke away entirely and then eventually into generally-independent fiefdoms. Despite all this upheaval, much of Colchis’ ingrained Greek culture was retained. As such, the noble classes of each city, although very much of mixed blood, fought in the traditional hoplite fashion."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_linen_legion"	"According to Livy, the Samnites observed strict religious rites in order to prepare them for difficult battles, such as the one used to raise the 'Linen Legion', a selection and oath-taking by the strongest Samnite warriors. A two hundred-foot square was fenced off and covered with linen cloth at the centre of a Samnite camp, where a priest would recite a sacrificial ceremony from an old linen book, calling the men to serve their state and to never retreat. Warriors who showed cowardice by refusing the oath were slain on the spot, discouraging others from doing so. This created a caste of warriors extremely devoted to their people's defence and advancement. Each man who took the oath also chose companions, who by an extension of trust joined the Linen Legion. These Samnites were then equipped with the best weapons and armour to distinguish themselves so others could follow them in battle - the Linen Legion represented the Samnite army's heart, able to turn religious fervour into effective military strength."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Archers_Long"	"Although archery was not highly thought of as a military skill in Greece, Crete produced truly excellent archers who were able to sell their services to the highest bidder as mercenaries. Firing bronze-tipped arrows from their heavy self bows, Cretan archers tended to carry shields, indicative of some additional prowess in melee, which must’ve made them an even more enticing proposition for a general hiring mercenaries for campaign. Their finest hours came when Alexander the Great hired Cretans directly into his army to support its unbeatable phalanx. Commanded by Clearchus, 500 Cretans accompanied the Macedonian phalanx into battle at Granicus, off-setting the Persians' numerical superiority on the day and enabling Alexander’s subsequent victory. Whereas the Romans didn’t traditionally use archers in their forces, once they conquered Greece Cretan archers began to appear as auxiliary troops in their armies. Notably, they fought in Caesar’s campaign in Gaul against Vercingetorix, causing him to rally the best archers the tribes could provide to range against them."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ste_Archers_Long"	"Far from being simple, ignorant barbarians, the various steppe tribes had a great cultural wealth. Living in an area stretching from the Caspian Sea to the northern shores of the Black Sea; the Greeks called them 'Scythians' and the Persians 'Saka', while a western group became known as the Sarmatians. Wearing trousers marked them as barbarians as far as the Greeks were concerned, before their tall, pointed caps and swarthy appearances were even considered. Looks apart, they were, however, exceptional horsemen, highly-skilled with composite-recurve bows and deadly hand-to-hand fighters. Grave goods suggest that Scythian women were as warlike as their men, and probably fought alongside them in battle. This may well be the origin of the Greek myths of Amazon warrior women."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_saba_marib_camel_cataphracts"	"The city of Marib was not only the seat of the kings of Saba, it was an important economical and agricultural centre, as well as a place of worship. Its temple complex had multi-storey buildings and was situated directly on top of the trade routes to India, in the heart of Arabia Felix. However, it's most prominent feature was the Great Marib Dam, built around the 8th century BC, although smaller dams and canals were constructed in the region for centuries. The dam's elaborate irrigation system allowed the Sabaeans to prosper through the trade of frankincense and myrrh, which they cultivated. This strong geographical position also helped them maintain their wealth and political power. Unfortunately, as the trade routes shifted north, the Sabaeans fell out of favour and their glorious civilisation declined around the 1st century AD."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_greek_two_halfer"	"It is thought that the Rhodians, a significant naval power in the eastern Mediterranean, developed the 'trihemiolia' or 'two-and-a-half' as a vessel for pirate hunting. Given that Rhodes is an island entirely reliant on the sea and shipping this is a believable theory. Pirates used the hemiola, a handy little vessel developed from the dieres or bireme, a ship with two rows of oars; it makes sense that pirate hunters would think of taking a trieres, or trireme, with three rows of oars and modifying it in a similar fashion. A trihemiolia still had three rows of oars on each side, but the top row was reduced to only half the number of oars, positioned midships. The result was a faster, handier vessel that provided a height advantage over a hemiola for any archers on board. There was also a strategic benefit to the Rhodians, who could only draw on the manpower of one island: they could have six trieres warships with full complements of rowers, or seven trihemiolias for the same number of men. The useful design was soon adopted by other maritime powers around the Mediterranean."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Velites_Long"	"Recruited from amongst Rome's poor and those too young to fight as hastati, the velites were the Roman army’s light infantry. They wore wolf skin head-dresses which are thought to have some totemic significance, although they were also worn to induce fear in their enemies. At the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, when Scipio Africanus confronted the Carthaginian general, Hannibal, it was the velites who helped fend off his initial elephant charge, utilising their light armour and weapons to move quickly around them. They harassed the elephants to a frenzy while the cavalry blew horns to disorientate the beasts. Hannibal had hoped to break the Roman lines with his elephants; instead, many of the frightened beasts turned on the Carthaginians. Those elephants who didn’t crash through their own lines were caught in a cleverly orchestrated manoeuvre, whereby the Romans carefully channelled them through gaps made in the cohorts' formation."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_rom_principes"	"It is probable that, following many engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat at the hands of the Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller, flexible units rather than large massed phalanxes, that the Romans learned the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx formation on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy. 'Principes' as a class of unit evolved from remnants of the old second army class following the reforms of Marcus Furius Camillus. Unlike the hastati, who were young warriors who fought on the frontlines, principes were older men in their prime with some experience behind them and sent into the fray to support the hastati only if they began to waver and break during battle."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_roman_four"	"There is a good deal of debate as to how large ancient warships worked; the principles are understood, but the details are not always so clear. A Roman 'quadreme' or Greek 'tetreres' would seem to have four rows of oars if the name is translated literally. However, it is unclear how four sets of oars each with one rower apiece could be used without them getting in a terrible tangle even with a magnificently trained crew, or how the top set of rowers would be able to handle the extremely long oars pitched at a steep angle and still produce any power. The chances are that the term 'oar' had become synonymous with 'rower' and that the lowest bank had more than one man per oar. The other option was to go back to a double row of oars, with two men apiece. Two banks of oars would also have made for a cheaper construction task for each ship. Either way, the result was a ship that could rival the lighter trireme in speed, yet had more deck space for a large fighting contingent or artillery pieces."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Gladiatrices"	"There are no documented examples of female gladiators prior to Nero’s rule, but they are hinted at; in AD19, Tiberius passed the Larinum Decree, specifically forbidding daughters of those in high office from becoming gladiators. From Nero’s until the rule of Septimus Severus, who banned the practice outright, female gladiatorial contests became a regular feature of the circuses. Their existence wasn’t restricted to the Italian peninsula either; the Credenhill dig at Herefordshire in the United Kingdom unearthed a female skeleton bearing bone formation consistent with gladiatorial training. Gladiatrices were armed and armoured as their male counterparts: with swords or spears, shields, and if they could afford them, galea helmets and manica arm-guards."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_saba_sabaean_camel_cataphracts"	"The warriors of the Sabaean region were light infantry, cavalry and archers, and fought as mercenaries and auxiliaries for the Roman Empire. Dressed desert-fashion, they were entirely familiar with and comfortable in arid places. This was secondary however, to their reputation as mostly-reliable fighters, of far more worth than ordinary citizens or levies. This was due to the independence that the Sabaean kingdom maintained from the 8th century BC to AD275. This record was based on military might as well as diplomacy and the spice trade including frankincense and myrrh. Never conquered by Rome, Sabaean warriors still found work as mercenaries and auxiliaries in Roman service."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_roman_five"	"The 'five', called a quinquereme in Latin and a penteres in Greek, was a ship first used by the Syracusans against the Carthaginians sometime around 398BC. Like other polyremes, a term meaning many-oared, the chances were that it did not have five banks of oars but that the word 'oar' was used to mean 'rower'. In such a case, the arrangement of rowers would be two-two-one going up from the waterline. It makes sense to keep as much weight as possible low in the vessel to help its stability; a high centre of gravity makes any ship liable to capsize if struck from the side. The quinquereme, then, would be a formidable vessel both in terms of appearance and combat value. With a large fighting contingent aboard and plenty of deck space, this heavy vessel could cope with most enemies and threats."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Car_General_Long"	"Carthage's generals, chosen from the ranks of the nobility, were elected to campaign against its enemies. A tribunal of elders, the Hundred and Four, held both civic and military judicial responsibility, and could appoint and punish Carthage’s generals as required. Punishment could take many forms, including penance or even crucifixion. Himilco, for example, abandoned his troops at the siege of Syracuse in 397BC. He visited every temple in Carthage dressed as a slave, and then starved himself to death as penance for his crime. Hasdrubal begged for mercy when Rome sacked Carthage in 146BC but his wife, unable to bear the shame, threw herself and their sons into the fire. By way of contrast, Hamilcar and Hannibal, his son, had success and were repeatedly appointed to command during the First and Second Punic Wars. Hannibal reformed the Hundred and Four into an elected body and, even following his voluntary exile to appease Rome in 195BC, continued to be feared by Rome until his death. The Carthaginians were also a little wary of his ambitions for power too."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Sas_Anatolian_Slingers"	"Anatolia lies south of the Black Sea, and its people were subject to many influences as their territory frequently changed hands between rulers as the balance of power ebbed and flowed. The tradition of using slings on the battlefield reaches back as far as the 6th century BC, when all of Anatolia was under Achaemenid Persian rule. From that point on, Anatolians saw almost constant conflict in their homeland, from the Greco-Persian Wars to the later clashes between Rome and Parthia. Despite not having access to good equipment, Anatolia's slingers were some of the deadliest wielders of the humble rock in the known world, able to take out enemy units over a considerable distance and quickly disengage."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_inv_veneti"	"The Veneti were an ancient Italic tribe who lived in northeastern Italy and some of the upper Adriatic regions, which Livy called their "corner". They were the only barbarian tribe in the region prior to the invasion of Gauls from beyond the Alps. The Veneti did not immediately come into conflict with the newcomers, unlike their more 'civilised' neighbours the Etruscans, instead coexisting peacefully. Polybius claims that the Veneti were heavily influenced by Gallic culture, and were seemingly identical to the Gauls except in their language. This Gallic influence did not mean the Veneti were warlike, however; instead, they preferred  animal husbandry, fishing and trade over war, and used bronze coins as early as the 7th century BC. The Veneti used a strong breed of horse that were even requested by Dionysius of Syracuse for use in the Olympic Games. According to Livy, the Veneti were originally descended from Antenor of Troy, who led the 'Heneti' to northeastern Italy to found the city of Patavium."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_roman_six"	"As centuries passed, naval tactics and needs changed across the Mediterranean. There was a move towards larger ships, partly as an expression of national or dynastic power: the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt were particularly fond of large ships to show their wealth and influence in a physical way. These 'polyremes', a term meaning many oared, were not suitable for ramming work in battle. In practice many of them had no more oars than smaller ships; what they had were more rowers per oar than smaller ships. A Roman hexareme or Greek hexeres would have a couple of banks of oars with three men per oar, and appear to be an over-sized version of a smaller ship. Even so, thanks to being tremendously heavy and strongly constructed, they were slow moving, and hardly capable of the quick turns needed to take advantage of enemy mistakes. Instead the large ships made use of their wide decks and plentiful carrying capacities and became fighting platforms for infantry and artillery. Boarding or long-range bombardment were the methods to be used to defeat the enemy; naval warfare had come full circle in terms of fighting methods, even if ships had grown significantly."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Eas_Hillmen_Long"	"Eastern hillmen tended to be light infantry skirmishers that excelled in mountainous and difficult terrain, as a result of defending their homelands against outsiders. Many hill tribes, including the Bithyni - after whom Bithynia was named - were descended Thracian migrants who crossed the Bosporus into Asia Minor; each had a fierce attachment to their own lands and a suspicion of plains folk and outlanders. Equipped in much the same manner as peltasts, they carried spears, javelins and daggers and their only protection was a shield, made from wicker, wood or hide. As a fighting force, they were fast moving and extremely manoeuvrable and not above trickery and deceit."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Molossian_Dogs_Long"	"Dogs have always been useful for guard, patrol and scout work. With skilled handlers they can also be used effectively on the battlefield. Attack dogs were specifically bred and trained to ignore the noise and chaos of combat. Taught to attack on command, they were starved a little to ensure aggression before being unleashed upon enemy formations as a savage wave. Faced with a pack of foaming, hungry dogs many men naturally broke or faltered, opening gaps in a battle line that could then be exploited by melee troops."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_roman_transport"	"For most of history the only way to move cargoes and people over long distances at any kind of reasonable speed was by water; this remained true until the invention of the railway. Trading vessels carried goods around the Mediterranean, following the coastlines for the most part, and up navigable rivers. The pattern of Greek settlement and colonisation was almost entirely based on where Greek ships could reach. It was also considerably easier to move armies by sea than march them long distances. Trade ships were hired or requisitioned for such tasks, and this was an added incentive for generals to reach a quick conclusion to a campaign: war hurt trade, and used up ships needed for vital food supplies."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Sas_Daylamite_Infantry"	"The Daylamites were people of the mountains - barbarians from central Persia, but never subject to direct Persian rule. Although it has been suggested that they originated near the source of the Tigris River in Anatolia, they nevertheless made their home in the Alborz, a mountain range to the north of modern-day Iran. The Daylamites were an extremely warlike people skilled in the use of many weapons, including battle axes, which were not commonly used in eastern warfare.  Known for their fierceness both on and away from the battlefield, Daylamite men were employed by the Sassanid Empire as high-quality infantry during the wars of late antiquity."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Gal_Gallic_Legionaries"	"The Gallic Roman Empire consisted of all the provinces of Transalpine Gaul, Germania, the Hispanic provinces, and Britannia, and its first Emperor was Marcus Cassianus Latinius Postumus. Likely a descendant of auxiliaries in Batavia, Postumus set out to make his own Empire in Rome's image. His Senate was formed of prominent citizens, military leaders, and Romanised chieftains, while Legionaries formed a new Praetorian Guard. Adopting the defence-in-depth method, Gallic Rome was known for its many forts across the Rhineland and having strong cavalry units, ready to respond to Germanic raids and invasions. Alliances with willing tribes along the borders also proved useful as a first line of defence. For instance, the Thuringi's support was valuable to Postumus and Legionaries were recruited from their young men, creating a new type of soldier, with Roman military traditions combined with barbaric aggression and strength."

During Aurelian's reign as Rome's Emperor, his forces pursued the Gothi into their territory north of the Danube and won many engagements, earning the title 'Gothicus Maximus'. After losing 5000 warriors and their king, Cannabas-Cannabaudes, the Gothi retreated north of the Danube river. In AD 291, two decades after their catastrophic loss to the Romans, the Gothi divided into two factions along tribal lines at the Dniester river, with the Greutungi and Tervingi and  tribes heading east and west respectively. The Tervingi, also known as forest people, later became the Visigoths, while Greutungi became known as the Ostrogoths."	"True"

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ger_Spear_Brothers_Long"	"Hardened by years of both inter-tribal combat and contact with enemies further afield, the most talented German warriors thus earned high status within their tribes. Whilst iron supplies were scarce, these men were privileged enough to equip themselves with lengthy spears, or 'framea', tipped with narrow, sharp points of iron. Whereas the framea was used for fighting at close quarters, lighter javelins were also carried to be hurled from a distance prior to melee. The taller and stronger the man, the bigger the spear he could carry; this established status, not only within the tribe, but also when facing the enemy."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_nab_hellenic_desert_cataphracts"	"The Nabataeans, although in dire relations with the Seleucids, borrowed many Hellenistic practices. As their empire expanded, the Seleucids tried to fold many nearby territories into it, looking to put a hand on the lucrative trade routes of southern Arabia as well. In the numerous military engagements between the two states, the Nabataeans developed the need to copy the greater disciplined, better structured Hellenistic way of fighting. They also used captured gear and although they were bitter rivals, admired the Greeks for their culture and civilisation. Most famous of these encounters are the Antigonid–Nabataean confrontations in 312BC. In the first instance, Antigonus appointed one of his officers, Athenaeus to pillage Petra. He did so successfully, as the defenders were away trading during the night of the raid. Not only was their stock captured, but also families, to be traded as slaves. However, the Nabataeans quickly realised the situation and were able to hunt down the 4,600-strong army and almost wipe it out, with only a few dozen escaping. Athenaeus was not among the survivors."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_num_desert_legionary_cavalry"	"Numidia had a fierce warrior tradition, partly because the eastern Massylii and western Masaesyli had a history of bitter feuding and internal warfare. They took, and changed, sides in the Punic Wars to suit their own agendas, only emerging as a single state after the cataclysmic Battle of Zama in 202BC. The defeat of Carthage allowed the Numidians to expand their lands, eventually leading to the Jugurthine War of 112-105BC against Rome. Numidia’s king, Jugurtha, was only defeated when he was betrayed by his father-in-law, Bocchus. While the Numidians were famed as cavalrymen, their infantry forces were also quite effective. The historian Suetonius mentions that there were Numidian 'legions', a term reserved for Roman troops, when passing comment on Julius Caesar’s speech regarding Juba’s march to aid Scipio before the Battle of Thapsus in 46BC. This suggests that some Numidians were fighting in the Roman style, and were possibly equipped in the same manner. The Numidians also adopted other tactics and war gear, such as the thureos-style shield and hoplite-like spears."	"True"

At around two to two and a half metres in height, they were an imposing beast capable of causing panic in enemies unused to facing them in battle. Having fought Syracusan elephants in Sicily in 278-276BC, the Carthaginians captured and tamed the local elephants rather than importing larger specimens from India. The Carthaginians did, however, hire Indian experts to form the most powerful elephant corps of the period. At Bagradas River in 255BC, the Carthaginian elephants caused many casualties, leaving the Romans fearful of battling the creatures for many years afterwards."	"True"

They roamed this region as they pleased, and had a fierce reputation as cavalrymen almost without equal. The Sarmatians were always horse archers by inclination, but their cavalry gradually adopted heavier and heavier armour as the centuries passed, eventually wearing heavy suits of scales, like the famed cataphracts of the east - even their horses wore full suits of scale armour. Despite this shift towards lances and shock cavalry tactics, Sarmatian riders still used their fearsome compound bows. With each man carrying a kontos, a long two-handed lance, they could smash through almost any enemy foolish enough to stand against them."	"True"

Usage was most prevalent amongst the Garamantians, and Herodotus recorded them raiding their southern Ethiopian neighbours using four-horse chariots. Whether drawn by two or four horses, chariots were built for speed and manoeuvrability, rather than impact and protection. They consisted of little more than yoke and a platform with axle and wheels at the back and a waist-high screen. The driver and passengers wore cloth armour and used javelins, or in some cases bows. The emphasis on speed probably comes from the role chariots played in hunting being transferred to the battlefield, especially when raiding for slaves. Despite their weight, when many chariots were drawn up together their impact against light or untrained infantry and cavalry could still be devastating!"	"True"

Many believe the statues to be Nuragic warriors, descendants of the ancient 'Sea People', a loose confederation of clans who fought the Aegean Greeks and Egypt during the Bronze Age. At the time, chariots were often used in combat, mostly to hold transport archers around the battlefield. The Nuragic warriors' purpose was to defeat these tactics by attacking the chariots with massed archers to pin them down and hold them in place. While immobile, the charioteers were vulnerable to attack by the swift Sardinians, called 'pugilatore' or 'boxers' - the Latin root of the English word 'pugilist', meaning 'fighter'; their large shields enabled them to protect themselves from enemy arrows and knock charioteers from their mounts with their glove-like weapons.

The people who lived there travelled in small tribes, only unifying occasionally for trade and celebration. Life in the desert necessitated the mastery of camels for both civil and military applications. It also required a reliance on a more fluid, hit-and-run style of fighting. Men from the desert fought swiftly, from the saddle, striking and vanishing again before the enemy had a chance to engage. Very few of these men were professional soldiers and none were formally trained or drilled, save for the noble-born."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_dk_num_heavy_numidian_skirmishers"	"The javelin is among the oldest weapons in the world. Equipped with javelins and little else, skirmishers harried their opposite numbers and peppered hoplite phalanxes before quickly retreating. This was the typical tactic of all unarmoured, javelin-armed troops: to engage at range and then fall back behind more heavily-armoured infantry, or continue attacks while trying to stay just out of reach of the enemy. Such harassment could be highly effective, in 391BC at the Battle of Lechaeum, a force of Spartans, lacking the support of skirmishers or cavalry, were severely punished by javelin-armed Athenians who refused to meet them at close quarters. Over time, shields became common, such as those used by Thracian and Greek peltasts, but in turn these were rendered obsolescent by the Hellenic thureophoroi. Nevertheless, javelinmen and other irregulars continued to play a part in many armies throughout antiquity."	"True"

Numidian cavalry were supremely agile, skirmishing with assured expertise before swinging around to escape as rapidly as they had arrived. Wearing only a thin tunic, they carried javelins and small wicker shields. At Cannae, the highpoint of Carthaginian military success, Hannibal’s right wing consisted of 3,500 Numidian cavalrymen. The Numidians attacked the Romans' allied cavalry and chased them from the field before returning to smash into the rear of the Roman lines. Considered the elite of the Carthaginian army during the Second Punic War, the Numidians' defection before the Battle of Zama arguably led to Scipio’s victory over Hannibal in the final stages of the conflict."

"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Spartan_Hoplites_Long"	"Conditioned from the age of seven for a life on campaign, and dedicated to full-time military training, the Spartans were exceptionally well drilled and masters of their weaponry and equipment. Anyone who lost their shield in battle was dishonoured: while cuirass and helmet were for protecting the individual, the shield was seen as protection for the entire phalanx. As such, the Spartans were a highly-disciplined and co-ordinated force, largely superior to any other on the battlefield. It was the Spartans who led the defence of the Peloponnese against the Persians in 480BC and, after two full days of battle, fought the famous last stand at Thermopylae. 300 Spartans and their Greek allies blocked the tiny pass between the cliffs and the sea, forcing the Persians to attack their deadly phalanx head on. When a Greek traitor eventually caused the Spartans to be outflanked, they fought to the very last man. The time spent defeating the Spartans was just enough for the remaining Greek allies to prepare a fleet to defeat the Persian navy decisively near the island of Salamis, ending the war."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Skirm_Cav_Long"	"Light Greek cavalry, these skirmishers used javelins to harry other cavalry and infantry, as well as to chase down skirmishers and fleeing troops. Recruited from amongst those citizens able to afford and stable a horse within the Greek city-states, they wore simple cloth armour and either rode bareback or used a saddlecloth-like blanket. Equipped with a supply of javelins and either a dagger or short sword, skirmish cavalry avoided direct confrontation, using their manoeuvrability to prevent heavier cavalry and infantry getting to grips with them. This limited their effectiveness in early Greek warfare to chasing off psiloi and running down fleeing hoplites, but as more cavalry and lighter types of infantry began to develop their usefulness increased. Often deployed to support the weaker left flank in battle, their role became one of misdirection and waylaying, while the traditionally stronger right flank would break the opposing line."	"True"

Taken from the original Greek 'klibanophoroi', their name means 'camp oven' or 'metallic furnace', probably due to the amount of armour that covered both man and horse. Having faced formidable opposition when fighting Palmyra and Sassanid Persia, the Romans soon realised that they would have to match their enemies' brutal heavy cavalry attack if they were to make any headway whatsoever in their wars against the eastern empires. Whereas cataphracts were traditionally armed with lances for charging, clibinarii carried all manner of clubs, maces, and axes which enabled them to get in close and literally smash their opponents to pieces in melee."

As the Spartans themselves could pursue no profession other than that of the warrior, the periokoi fulfilled the roles of artisans and merchants in the Lacedaemonian state, eventually taking on the roles in the Spartan army considered unsuitable for true citizens, such as skirmishing and cavalry. Living along the coast and in the many hill towns surrounding the fertile valleys of Eurotas and Pamisos, they acted as a barrier between the Spartan citizens and the rest of Greece - a barrier that also kept in the helots, the Spartans' slaves that farmed the valleys below the city. Like other Greeks, the periokoi were expected to purchase and maintain their own arms and armour, each town contributing to the Spartan war machine when required. Even though they were allowed their own laws and customs, as non-citizens periokoi could not influence or vote on Spartan foreign or military policy."	"True"

Light infantry, they were often armed with javelins or medium length spears and used shields covered in animal hide. Such shields could also be scaled with either horn or metal. This type of armour also extended to their clothing at times, with scaled versions of their tunics becoming widespread, especially amongst the nobility. These men also made extensive use of daggers, straight swords and the fearsome sagaris, a one-handed battle-axe, with both a bladed or hammer-like head and a pick-like point on the reverse for punching through armour. Complimenting their foot archers and horsemen, the role of such men was simply to protect the former from the latter. Far from barbarians, steppe culture, although nomadic, was a rich and diverse one."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Aux_Afr_Spr_Long"	"The warriors of the Sabaean region were light infantry, cavalry and archers as mercenaries and auxiliaries for the Roman Empire. Dressed desert-fashion, they were entirely familiar with and comfortable in arid places. This was secondary however, to their reputation as mostly reliable fighters, of far more worth than ordinary citizens or levies. This was due to the independence that the Sabaean kingdom maintained from the 8th century BC to AD275. This record was based on military might as well as diplomacy and the spice trade including frankincense and myrrh. Never conquered by Rome, Sabaean warriors still found work as mercenaries and auxiliaries in Roman service."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_War_Pig_Long"	"In battle, pigs were exploited for the panic they caused in elephants. Of the various methods developed to contend with them (skirmishers, fire arrows, ground traps, specialist troops and special formations), the pig was by far the most ingenious method of countering elephants. Elephants simply cannot cope with the high-pitched squeals of a pig. The Romans were quick to realise this and, by covering pigs in thick tar and setting fire to them, made them all the more disturbing. At the Battle of Beneventum in 274BC, the Romans used pigs against King Pyrrhus of Epirus. The burning pigs ran between the legs of the panicked elephants, who turned in flight and routed through their own army, giving the Romans a momentous, almost effortless, victory."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ste_Lancers_Long"	"Developed from the cavalry skills of their ancestors, the steppe lancers of the Scythian, or Saka, tribes and the Sarmatians were a type of heavy cavalry comparable to their Hellenic counterparts. They wore scale armour to protect themselves and their mounts, and used a long lance known as a kontos. This enabled them to deliver devastating charges in a fashion comparable to the Alexandrian Companion cavalry. The scale armour was made from horn, or later metal, and allowed the wearers to run down their western counterparts. They were still vulnerable to dense pike or spear-armed formations. Archery provided a solution: sustained volleys from skirmishing foot and horse archers were used to thin and spread out the enemy. At the Battle of Carrhae in 53BC, the tightly-packed Roman infantry were forced to spread out by Parthian archers, which enabled their cataphracts to charge and break an overconfident Roman force four times their number."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ibe_Painted_Warriors_Long"	"The Arevaci were a Celtiberian tribe of warriors and horsemen. As a group the Celtiberians were regarded by their contemporaries as odd to the point of being quite intimidating, if not downright scary. Among their many bizarre little ways it was the custom of washing their bodies, hair and teeth in urine that made others think them deranged. The Celtiberians seem to have been convinced of urine’s healing properties. They also went into battle painted orange. The dye paste they used was thought to toughen the skin, but the morale impact on enemies must have been considerable. Other Celts tattooed and painted themselves for battle. Some Britons dyed themselves blue by using an extract of woad; this must have been something of a trial for everyone else, as processing woad to make dye produces a magnificently disgusting smell as well as a rich blue colour."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Gre_Foot_Companions_Long"	"Historically, the Macedonian phalanx innovated the use of the fearsome sarissa: a pike of up to 21 feet in length. First introduced to the army by Alexander the Great’s father, Phillip II, the sarissa was cumbersome but created an almost impregnable phalanx formation. Presenting a wall of pikes from five files of men, it protected more of the front ranks and created a much bigger killing zone than the traditional hoplite phalanx. Defensively, the Macedonian phalanx could not only withstand and repel any cavalry or infantry charge to the front, it could also deflect incoming arrows, as the back rows kept their pikes vertical until needed. Arrows were caught up in the raised pikes and fell harmlessly to the ground, where they could be repurposed by the deadly Cretan archers fielded to support the pikes. Thusly, the Macedonian attack, whilst slow-moving, could also be unstoppable: if coordinated and disciplined, it simply steamrollered its enemies from the field. Following his untimely death, the 'Diadochi' - Alexander's 'Successors' - continued to use and further refine pike phalanx combat."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Mer_Ger_Scout_Riders_Long"	"German cavalry were much sought-after mercenaries, including by the Romans after the defeat of the Belgic alliance in 57BC. During their attacks into Gaul, the disciplined Nervii cavalry managed to cross the Rhine in a single day, ambushing and defeating the Menapii. Caesar was greatly impressed by their bravery and fighting abilities. He faced the Germans himself at Sabis, and was almost defeated before managing to encircle and destroy them. The remaining Nervii joined the rebellion against Quintus Tullius Cicero, besieging his winter camp until relieved Caesar broke the siege. They Nervii were eventually overwhelmed, but Caesar did recruit a band of German horsemen into his army for his war against the Gauls."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Ind_Armour_Elephants_Long"	"War elephants were not battle-winning weapons on their own. They needed to be used properly, and given the right support if they were to break an enemy line and the enemy’s will to fight on. They would often be accompanied into battle with a screen of friendly skirmishers. It was their job to keep the elephants from being harassed by the enemy’s light troops, allowing the elephants to attack unmolested. The sheer size of an elephant was enough to instil terror, before its tusks impaled men, or it hurled enemies away or trampled them to death. Even in the best conditions, elephants could be unpredictable: they could react with anger if their handlers were killed or wounded, but they could also turn on the same men when they had reached breaking point. Sent forwards at the right moment, though, and they could sweep all before them."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_Rom_Vigiles_Long"	"Vigiles were stationed around Rome and were responsible for dealing with any unrest that occurred after dark. Keeping the peace was just one part of their work as they also acted as Rome’s fire department. They were equipped with pumps to douse small fires, but a blaze could spread quickly through tight-packed streets, so often buildings were torn down to make fire breaks. Vigiles did this with impressive speed, and men were specially trained to remove roofs and knock down walls. In extreme cases they used onagers to knock down buildings in a matter of seconds."	"True"
"unit_description_historical_texts_text_3c_Aux_Unit_Generic_Long"	"The auxilia incorporated all standing non-citizen military units of the Imperial Roman army during the Principate era, containing roughly the same numbers of infantry as the Legions as well as more specialised troops, such as light cavalry and archers. Auxiliary regiments were stationed in the lands where they were originally recruited in order to boost the process of Romanisation a
