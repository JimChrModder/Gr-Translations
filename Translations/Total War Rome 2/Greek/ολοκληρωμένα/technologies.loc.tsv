"technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_construction_strengthened_walls"	"A city’s walls were far more than a boundary to enclose a settlement: they protected those within from would-be aggressors. Defensive walls were first seen in Mesopotamia around 3000BC, when inter-city conflict increased the need for protection. Walls were seen as iconic structures directly linked to the power of the city’s god. They were often vast and complex structures. The walls of Babylon boasted a corridor-like chamber, separated by over 100 bronze gates, which ran its entire length and was wide enough to give passage to a four-horse chariot."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_nomad_military_warrior_code_composite_bow_training"	"A composite bow is made of many layers, cleverly arranged to take advantage of the properties of each: the outside of the bow is often sinew, which stretches, attached to a wooden core, with horn, which can be compressed, on the inside facing the bowman. Such a weapon can store more energy when pulled than a simple wooden bow of similar size. This makes the composite bow an excellent weapon for mounted archers, as a large bow would constantly get tangled up in reins, or could not be quickly swung across the horse’s neck. However, archery is not a skill that is quickly mastered; archery from the back of a galloping horse is a skill doubly difficult to master, and until a mounted bowman can not only control his mount, usually with his knees, and string, aim and release an arrow at full gallop to hit the target, he is not a true steppe nomad warrior."

"technologies_long_description_pel_military_support_cavalry_tactics"	"Across most of the ancient world, to fight as cavalry required the financial means to field a war horse. This, in turn, meant that the vast majority of cavalrymen were of noble birth or, in Athens and many of the other democratic or oligarchic Greek city-states, of a high social class. Unfortunately, it doesn’t follow that those with the best armour and equipment necessarily made good fighters; controlling a horse in the thick of battle whilst protecting it and yourself from harm was no easy feat, it required lengthy training. Cavalry - or ‘hippeis’ in Greek - often carried either a javelin or a long ‘xyston’ lance in addition to a double-edged sword for swinging in melee. Greek horsemanship of the day was quite different to later forms. As the stirrup had yet to be invented, the rider’s legs were free to direct the animal. However, saddles were just a simple felt cloth tied around its belly, so good balance was absolutely essential. Greek cavalrymen trained to charge, skirmish and melee in this way."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_pel_military_support_peltast_trainning"	"After centuries spent dedicated to perfecting hoplite warfare, Greek tacticians began to develop skirmish tactics to support the mighty phalanx. As a result, infantry slingers, archers and javelinmen were fielded by Greek armies from the time of the Persian invasion onwards, but more prominently during the Peloponnesian War by generals such as Iphicrates. The skirmisher's winning tactic was to get in close, shower the enemy flanks with missiles and then withdraw in good order, with minimal melee. Designed to break the stalemate that could occur when massed spears pushed against each other, peltasts were named for the small, wicker 'pelta' shields they carried; however, the word eventually became synonymous with the javelin combat they practised. At first, Thracians, with whom many skirmish tactics had originated, were exclusively employed as mercenary peltasts, but gradually the skills required spread right across Greece. Despite this, peltasts are often depicted in art wearing the distinctive 'Phrygian' caps popular among Thracian soldiers of the day."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_navy_epic_naval_architecture"	"All warships in the ancient world were limited in size by a number of practical considerations. This meant most warships were triremes or 'threes', or perhaps quinqueremes or 'fives', usually named for the number of banks of oars or the number of rowers. Being propelled by oars brought limits: there were only so many rowers that could operate a single oar; there was a practical limit to the stroke and angle of an oar; and so forth. There was also a limit to how long and slender a galley could be before it would flex too much in any kind of sea and tear itself to pieces, but too broad a beam would make it a lumbering target. None of these constraints mattered a jot to some nations, who built increasingly large vessels, culminating in a few '30s' and even a couple of '40s'. These gargantuan vessels must have been catamarans with fighting platforms linking the hulls, but they were all little more than vanity projects for the kings and Pharaohs who ordered them built."

"technologies_long_description_rom_syracuse_engineering_construction_archimedes_screw"	"Although there are others from earlier times who could lay claim to it, the invention of the screw pump is generally attributed to the great Greek scientist and mathematician, Archimedes (287-212BC), during a visit to Egypt. His design was a pump that utilised a rotating spiral plate to lift water between levels; the device enabling effective drainage of mine workings and irrigation of hillside crops with greatly reduced effort. Archimedes was a well-known inventor during his life, so much so that the Roman general Marcus Claudius Marcellus ordered that he be spared during Rome’s final assault on Syracuse in 212BC, as a useful asset who could be ranged against Carthage. Unfortunately, his refusal to comply with a Roman soldier’s order ended his life prematurely. Irritated by the interruption whilst he was contemplating a complex mathematical diagram, Archimedes allegedly uttered “Do not disturb my circles!”, enraging the man who promptly drew his sword and killed him on the spot."

The mathematical evidence provided is known as the 'Pythagorean proof', or proof by rearrangement. It involves two squares with the same four triangles placed inside. Each square has a different arrangement of the triangles, yet the space between them remains the same, proving that the hypotenuse is calculable using the fixed states of the other sides."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_mathematics_architectural_illusions"	"Ancient Greek architects employed several illusory techniques to enhance their works. One of the most widely used techniques was 'entasis', the addition of convex curves to the columns of temples. The most famous example of entasis is the Parthenon of Athens, where the columns lean inwards as they rise, in theory converging one mile into the sky if allowed to continue. One of the biggest questions, however, is why this was done at all. Some suggest it was an aesthetic choice - at the Parthenon, the entasis gives the effect of swelling, as if burdened by the weight of the building's roof. Others believe it was to increase the impression of straight columns when standing outside looking up. This is because the Parthenon doesn't have any straight lines - simply the illusion of them."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_aesthetics_comedy_plays"	"Ancient Greek comedy was divided into three disciplines - 'old', 'middle' and 'new', of which varying amounts of each survive. Aristotle defines Greek comedy in his 'Poetics' as representing laughable people, involving mischief and stupidity that, though amusing, has no lasting damage. Whilst true, early Greek comedy was also known for its potent political satire, mixed together with slapstick and innuendo. The works of Aristophanes, who wrote old comedy, made mockery of important figures such as Socrates in 'Lysistrata'. Aristophanes, along with his contemporaries Hermippus and Eupolis, defined the genre. Little is known about middle comedy, as no examples exist beyond fragmented excerpts. New comedy denoted a shift from slapstick to comedies of situation and manners. Greek comedy, of all styles, has influenced the modern form hugely - new comedy continues to influence a raft of sitcom writing, whilst the subtle, skewering slapstick of old comedy helped inform the madcap work of groups such as Monty Python."

The Romans found themselves able to renegotiate many treaties, and forge new ones also. Macedon, with whom Carthage had entreated aid in the war, signed the Treaty of Phoenice with Rome in 205BC, after it became obvious the conflict had reached a stalemate. This deprived Hannibal of the fresh Greek reinforcements he sought which, along with the loss of his brother Hasdrubal's army and the defection of Numidian tribes, signalled an irreversible change in Carthaginian fortunes."

"technologies_long_description_rom_nomad_military_warrior_code_head_token"	"As is so often the case, a people’s enemies have a tendency to call them savage and dangerous in warfare; there is, after all, little glory in beating weaklings and cowards. The Scythians, however, do seem to have been particularly savage and merciless to their foes, and fully deserving of the reputation they were given by their civilised victims. Their practice of taking heads and, according to some sources, scalps, was not all that unusual; Gallic tribes took the heads of their enemies as trophies. It was the Scythian method of dividing the spoils after a battle that set them apart: men would be rewarded according the number of, and (presumably) the previously-living status of, heads that they took in battle. The heads themselves therefore attained the status of a currency used to purchase a share of captured enemy baggage."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_military_support_supply_tunnels"	"As military campaigns gradually increased in size and scope, and sieges dragged on into years, the Greeks had to call on all their powers of ingenuity to keep their armies supplied and populations alive. Men such as Eupalinos, from the Corinthian dependency Megara, did much to advance the science of civil engineering. His tunnel, on the island of Samos, was designed to bring water to the people of the city even when under siege. Covering a distance of almost 3,500 feet, the tunnel had to pass through the limestone base of Mount Kastro. It was a mammoth task, but Eupalinos succeeded, where many others had failed, by using geometry to solve the engineering problems he faced. Two teams of diggers, one outside at the foot of the mountain, the other inside the city, followed his careful calculations – all fundamental geometric tenets – to burrow into the rock and meet in the middle. Eupalinos ensured the result by using a technique whereby the direction of each tunnel was changed slightly at a crucial point. This guaranteed that, even with an error of up to two metres, one tunnel would break into the path of the other. Used as an aqueduct for a thousand years, the Tunnel of Eupalinos eventually fell into disuse, but was rediscovered in the 19th century. It has remained a tourist attraction since that time."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_egypt_military_management_cultural_assimilation"	"As military tactics developed, so too did the need for specialist troops to use them. This prompted the Pharaoh and his generals to look to captured lands for recruits with useful skills. Egyptian culture dominated Nubia after its re-conquest, and Egyptian gods, hieroglyphs and social structure were imposed. Even so, the skills of the locals were prized and exploited: Nubian archers were recruited in Pharaoh’s armies, and were said to be buried with their bows. Egypt also recruited troops among the Medjay, a nomadic people of lower Nubia. They provided warriors, scouts and the police to guard royal palaces.

It was not a particularly safe practice, and some who drank the spirits’ brews did not wake again in the mortal world. The Scythians had a slightly different approach, and made sauna-like smoking tent where smouldering pits of herbs could be burned and the smoke breathed in. In the form of hemp, cannabis had been used by people in many ways for thousands of years, both for its intoxicating effects and as a practical material. Hemp fibre is incredibly tough stuff, and can be woven to make good quality yarn, cloth and even rope. The chemicals released when the plant is burned have a number of effects on the human brain which can be interpreted as religious or spiritual but, like anything used in excess, the effects can be counterproductive, particularly in a tough, warrior culture like that of the nomadic Scythians."

Meeting the optimum conditions for bees was a Herculean task: the climate had to be warm but not sweltering, with hives located near reliable food sources and water supplies. Separating the bees from their honey was also demanding. Dry dung mixed with coal was burnt in a pot and the smoke was poured into the hive to force the bees out. Once the combs were gathered they had to be drained of honey and kept out of reach of the angry bees."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_military_top_war_preparations"	"Before Hannibal, Rome had never faced an enemy so determined to bring about its total destruction, and the resultant level of mobilisation was unprecedented in its history. The fall of Saguntum and subsequent crossing of the River Iber had a profound effect on the Romans; they immediately prepared for war, levying additional Legions and building up their navy. Forces were sent to guard Sicily; as the principle theatre during their first war with Carthage, the Romans assumed the Carthaginians would try to regain control of the island. This also enabled them to strike at Carthage itself. Further Legions were raised and sent to check Hannibal's progress through Iberia, and were surprised to discover he had already entered Gaul by the time they reached their allies in Massilia, on the Rhone. After failing to engage Hannibal's army, which had headed north towards the foot of the Alps, most of the Roman army continued on into Iberia, hoping to undermine the remaining Barcid presence there."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_civil_diplomacy_iberian_mission"	"Before the Second Punic War, Rome had limited, yet successful, relations with some of the civilisations and tribes on the Iberian peninsula. For instance, the settlement of Saguntum, whose assault was Hannibal's opening move of the war, had previously been pro-Roman, having aided the Republic in Rome's first war against Carthage. In an effort to halt Hannibal's advance, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio and his brother, Publius, were sent to the region in order to rekindle relations and foster anti-Carthaginian sentiment amongst the Iberians. If Iberia was wrested from Barcid hands, supplies intended for Hannibal could be rerouted to Rome instead."	"True"

By sharing blood two warriors become symbolic brothers, and are expected to treat each other as family members in all respects. Unlike modern interpretations of blood oaths, where both individuals make cuts and press them together so that their blood mingles, the Scythian oath involved shedding of a blood into a cup. The men then drank the mingled blood and demonstrated their mutual loyalty as brothers. No man was allowed more than three blood brothers, if only to avoid any potential tangles in conflicting obligations to different blood brothers. The custom of drinking the blood also neatly side-stepped any transfer of blood-borne diseases from one man to another by direct cut-to-cut transfer."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_dlc_gaul_roman_politics_0_adopt_marc_antony"	"Born in 83BC, Marc Antony’s mother, Julia, was the cousin of Julius Caesar. Close family ties, loyalty to his commander, and a desire for power made Marc Antony one of Caesar’s most important supporters, both as a military leader and in politics. In 54BC, after commanding a Gallic cavalry regiment in Syria and Judea, he joined Caesar’s staff in Gaul and fought alongside him throughout his Gallic Wars. With Caesars’ political enemies circling in 50BC, as his ten-year Proconsulship came to an end, he secured Marc Antony the offices of Quaestor and Tribune. Attempting to use his veto to protect Caesar’s imperium, Antony was violently expelled from the Senate. This was one of the grievances that Caesar used as a reason to cross the Rubicon, starting the Civil War."	"True"

In exchange for his Consulship in 59BC, Caesar agreed to pass Pompey’s land requests for his veterans and confirm the various political settlements he’d orchestrated in Asia. At the same time, Caesar managed to bring both Pompey and Crassus, previously political opponents, together to form what would become known as the First Triumvirate. This political alliance was further strengthened by the marriage of Pompey and Julia, Caesar’s daughter from his first marriage, Cornelia Cinna. Their marriage, and the close bond it represented between their ambitious families, did much to alarm their opponents, such as Cato and Cicero."	"True"

Whilst Rome was occupied with its Illyrian wars, he struck out in the opposite direction, into Iberia, and there set about refilling Carthaginian coffers by exploiting the rich silver deposits to be found there.

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_mathematics_cartography"	"Cartography is the science of map-making; a way of explaining the geography and topography of the physical world in a simplified graphical form. As explorers and soldiers, the ancient Greeks made important developments in this field. Of particular note is Hecataeus of Miletus, a Greek geographer and historian who lived in the late 6th and early 5th centuries BC, around the time of the Persian invasion. As a wealthy citizen of Miletus, in Asia Minor, Hecataeus was able to leave his home city and travel the Mediterranean. Lauded as a hero on his return and given an influential position in Miletus’ government, he was able to devote much of his time to compiling what he had learned in a number of famous works, including, it is thought, “Travels round the Earth” and “World Survey”. Alongside a survey of the coastlines visited in geographical order, each volume contains an illustrative map. Building on important cartographical work by Anaximander (610-546BC), Hecataeus was able to produce a much larger version with many additions and corrections. The map depicted the known world as a flat disc surrounded by ocean, including Europe as far north as Scythia and as far west as Iberia and Gaul, Asia as far east as Persia, and Africa from Egypt to Carthage. Although most of Hecataeus’ great labour has been lost to time, 374 fragments survive as quoted in Ethnika, a more complete geographical compendium from the 6th century AD."	"True"

It was created following an embargo on the export of papyrus from Ptolemaic Egypt, ostensibly due to over-harvesting of the reeds used to produce it, but possibly also due in part to animosity between Ptolemy and Eumenes caused by the construction of a great library at Pergamon to rival Alexandria’s. Whereas papyrus was made from reed stems cut into strips and layered into scrolls, pergaminus consisted of animal hide, particularly calfskin, that was stretched and then scraped to remove all oils and remnants of flesh before drying. Although its production methods have been refined over the centuries, parchment is essentially made in the same way today, although on a far smaller scale since the development of paper from wood pulp, of course."

"technologies_long_description_rom_dlc_gaul_roman_politics_caesar_1_befriend_gallic_chieftains"	"Divide and conquer was one of the most basic tenets of Caesar’s campaigns in Gaul. Combined, the sheer numbers of the tribes he faced would have overwhelmed his Legions in battle and cut off his supply lines. Instead he was able to work with allied tribes, such as the Aedui, and cow or subjugate others to his cause, such as the Suessiones and Bellovaci. Clemency was key to this strategy and Caesar often spared his enemies, ordering them instead to disarm and provide hostages as assurance of peace. Subjugated tribes also became clients of pro-Roman factions, such as the Aedui, making them, to an extent, self-policing."	"True"

The Eleatic School of Philosophy was founded by Parmenides of Elea in the early 5th century BC. Parmenides was a pre-Socratic scholar in ancient Greece, and his philosophies attracted a number of followers - notably Zeno of Elea, and Melissus of Samos. Zeno enjoyed confounding his opponents through the application of something later called 'reductio ad absurdum', which attempts to reduce arguments to absurdity to prove their inefficacy. One famous argument was 'Achilles and the Tortoise', which stated that, if given a 100 metre head start in a race, the tortoise would always win. Zeno reasoned that, in order to catch up, Achilles must first reach the point at which the tortoise started. However, by the time he arrived it would have pulled further ahead, so he must then catch up again, and so on. Following this method, Achilles could never win. Although Zeno's arguments bordered on the absurd, the general sway of eleatics was to foster a discussion about what can be observed and what can be proved. This went on to inform the philosophies of later Greek scholars, despite eleatics itself being mostly dismissed in the process."	"True"

The image of gentle herdsmen moving slowly across the steppes in search of rich grasslands is, however, less than the whole picture.

That the Dacians were brave warriors was never in question, but their ferocious tenacity in the face of the Legions set them apart from other peoples of the time. At their most powerful under King Burebista, who in the 1st century BC ruled over almost half a million square kilometres of territory occupied by two million subjects, Dacia successfully resisted Rome for well over a century. During this time, Roman armies were annihilated and, disastrously, Eagles were lost to Dacian forces on more than one occasion.

Without the sanction of the Senate, Pompey ‘loaned’ him one of his. It was a move that shocked their political opponents, such as Cato and the Optimates.

"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_military_management_mass_mobilisation"	"Following the siege of Saguntum, the Roman Senate decreed six Legions be raised, totalling approximately 70,000 men in number. Such a reaction echoed the determination to defeat an enemy Rome genuinely thought could destroy it; a determination, unusually, which only grew stronger as the war progressed in Carthage's favour. Despite several more humiliating defeats at Hannibal's hands, the Romans continued to raise large citizen armies. In preparation for the cataclysmic Battle of Cannae the Senate ordered the raising of eight Legions - as many as 90,000 men - in a desperate attempt to remove the Carthaginian threat from Roman soil once and for all. However, Cannae turned out to be Hannibal's greatest victory of the war. The destruction of yet another army would've crushed a lesser nation, but Rome refused to be brought to terms and moved to a state of full mobilisation of the remaining male population. Taking full advantage of Hannibal's inability to strike decisively following his victory, it bought the time needed to rebuild its forces."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_rom_illyrian_military_war_exercises_illyrian_spirit"	"For the Illyrian people, the realities of their living circumstances led to the emergence of the relentless, buccaneering spirit for which they became infamous. The homelands of the Ardiaei, Dardani and other Illyrian tribes proved unsuitable for the large scale agriculture required to support a growing population, so they turned to fishing off the Adriatic coast to support their people. For such a warlike people, however, this would never be enough. Eventually, many Illyrians took up sea-borne piracy to survive and prosper. Whereas many more 'civilised' states took a harsh view of such piratical behaviour, in Illyria it was endorsed and even sponsored by the ruling nobles. Queen Teuta, who ruled the Ardiaei at the time of the Illyrian wars with Rome, famously stated, when pressed to take action by the Romans, that she had no right to interfere in the private mercantile ventures of her subjects. "It was never the custom of royalty to prevent the advantage of its subjects as they could get from the sea", she said, angering the Roman envoy sent to remonstrate with her, who retorted "we have an excellent custom of punishing private wrongs with public revenge". Following this momentous exchange, the stage was set for a lengthy, devastating war that eventually led to both Teuta's downfall and the absorption of her realm into the Roman empire."	"True"

At the end of the Peloponnesian War's first year, the respected Athenian politician Pericles delivered the epitaph for the fallen, diverging from the hitherto standard pattern of funeral orations. Rather than glorifying the dead specifically, Pericles sang the praises of Athens itself, crediting the fallen by lauding the city they died for. He cited the enormous difficulty, if not impossibility, of the task of speaking on the dead's behalf, and implored the audience to live up to the standard set for them by the honoured dead."	"True"

A Legion consisted of ten cohorts of 480 men each rather than 30 maniples; each cohort was divided into six centuries of 80 men. This was later raised to a nominal strength of 600, with each century having 100 men; casualties meant that this was rarely the case in practice.

Men like Pythagoras created watertight rules that are still used today, yet the study of geometry as we know it today was mastered, or at least codified, by Euclid of Alexandria.

To own and wear gold was a sign not only of wealth, but of majesty, might and personal greatness.

"technologies_long_description_pel_military_army_hierarchy"	"Greek military hierarchy was analogous to that of the Romans, and generally of the civilised world of antiquity. The basic unit of the phalanx was the 'lochoi' or 'lochos' - a line of armoured, armed hoplites. Roughly ten lines deep, they moved as a tight group in combat. In the Athenian army, the lochos was governed by a captain known as the 'lochagos', and several lochoi formed a regiment or 'taxeis', in turn led by another commander, the 'taxiarchos'. The Spartans, being a much more militarised society, were initially divided into 'phratra' (fraternities) before also adopting lochoi, which were drawn from their villages. The Spartan army was led by both Spartan kings, but after the 6th century BC one remained in Sparta whilst the other went to war. They were free to battle partly because of Sparta's militaristic nature, but also because true Spartan power lay not with them, but with its elected council."	"True"

At a tribal level, Hellenisation was most prevalent among the noble classes, who aspired to be as 'civilised' as the Greeks. However, many defeats at Greek hands also caused a gradual shift in Illyrian and Thracian military thinking, which in turn led them to field their own version of the hoplite phalanx and a heavier version of the traditional peltast; a lightly-armoured skirmisher who could also fight just as effectively in melee."

"technologies_long_description_pel_military_army_phalanx_drill"	"Hoplites date back to the wars between the Greek city-states in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. During the Greco-Persian Wars most hoplites wore a Corinthian-style bronze helm, and a cuirass of bronze or stiffened linen or canvas. They were armed with a short sword and an iron-tipped spear with a bronze counterbalance butt-spike. Hoplites were named, though, after the round hoplon shield they carried. The hoplon-and-spear combination required them to fight as a phalanx, a block of spearmen some eight ranks deep. When closed up, each man would find shelter behind the shield of his neighbour, creating a wall of bristling spear-points.

"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_civil_laws_lex_claudia_de_senatorbius"	"In 218BC the plebeian Tribune, Quintus Claudius, pushed a law through the Senate preventing its members or their children from owning ships that could carry more than 300 amphorae. 'Lex Claudia de Senatoribus' was designed to stop patrician families from making profit through overseas trade, thereby influencing their Senatorial decisions when it came to fighting foreign wars. Technically, mercantile activity was already illegal for them, being seen as too low-born a profession for the land-owning classes, but judicious use of loopholes in the law had allowed its circumvention up to this point. The new ruling resulted in many Senators looking inwards, investing in businesses and agriculture within Italy itself. During the war against Hannibal this had the desired effect of focusing everyone's attention upon the very real, looming threat coming to destroy Roman hegemony in the Italian peninsula, if not the city itself."

"technologies_long_description_pel_military_army_common_shield_decoration"	"In 424BC, the forces of Athens and the Boeotian League clashed at the Battle of Delium, not far from Athens itself. The battle was a victory for the Boeotians, in part because of confusion that arose in the midst of the battle. The Athenian forces, enjoying victory, encircled a contingent of Boeotians and, unable to distinguish their shields from those of their enemies, began indiscriminately killing friend and foe alike in the first documented incident of collateral damage. The hoplite shield was a common sight, and of standardised construction since the 5th century BC. No state crests were applied to them until Sparta faced Thebes for the second time at Mantineia, in 362BC. The Thebans painted the image of a club to their shields, and likewise the Spartans emblazed a lambda (for Lacadaemonia) upon theirs. This national emblem soon became widespread and made troops distinguishable in an era where so many armies looked the same."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_dlc_gaul_roman_politics_pompey_2_gladiatorial_games"	"In a further display of devotion to his daughter Julia, Caesar held gladiatorial games in her memory. As such, she was the first woman to receive such an honour. An increasingly common practice in the late Republic and throughout the Empire that followed, such munera, or ‘obligations’, would be held to honour the manes, or ‘souls of deceased loved ones’. Caesar’s lavish games in remembrance of his daughter took place in September 46BC, to coincide with the ludi Veneris Genetricis, that honoured the divine ancestor of the Julian family."	"True"

According to Caesar, such a council took place after the defeat of the Helvetii, when representatives from across Gaul came to congratulate him on his victory and seek aid against Ariovistus of the Suebi. Druids, such as Diviciacus of the Aedui, were often the spokespersons for such delegations."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_dlc_gaul_roman_politics_caesar_1_appoint_legates"	"In an attempt to strengthen his power in Rome, Caesar appointed Legates for political reasons as well as their military skill. His appointment of Quintus Tullius Cicero to his staff from 54-52BC is a clear example, a move to curry favour with his more famous brother, the orator Marcus Tullius Cicero. In 53BC, Quintus and his Legion were dispatched to oversee the subjugated Nervii. Their subsequent rebellion, inspired by the Eburones massacre of the XIV Legion, led Caesar to praise Quintus’ fortitude in defence against the ferocious Nervii. Such praise, combined with Pompey’s campaign for his return from exile, did much to bring Rome’s foremost orator around to their cause."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_philosopphy_sophist_trainning"	"In ancient Greece and Rome, a sophist was a teacher of rhetoric and philosophy primarily, although some focused on other subjects such as the arts and sciences. The word is derived from the Greek 'sophia', which means wisdom, and was a core tenet in Hellenic philosophy. Sophists took on the role of teachers for the nobility and younger statesmen; they were paid exorbitantly for their services, making theirs a role of renown and prestige. In the 5th century BC, particularly in Athens, the sophists were known as a class of travelling intellectuals, and made up for any lack of knowledge with mastery of rhetoric, to better hide their inadequacies and entertain their audiences. Prominent scholars, such as Plato and Aristotle, described the sophist ways as empty rhetoric, resulting in many sources being tainted by bias."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_civil_philosophy_philhellenism"	"In antiquity, the term 'philhellene' referred to non-Greeks who were interested in Greek culture and also to Greeks keen to uphold their culture and traditions. In Pontus, for example, the Persian aristocracy adopted many Greek customs and trappings, enabling them to better manage their Greek colonists. They, in turn, sought to maintain their cultural identity and friendly relations with neighbouring Hellenistic states. During the Mithridatic Wars, between the Kingdom of Pontus and Rome in the 1st century BC, Mithridates VI took philhellenism a stage further, presenting himself as the defender of all Hellenic culture and Greece in particular. It was a useful piece of political posturing."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_dlc_gaul_roman_politics_pompey_2_banquet_for_julia"	"In August 54BC, Julia died in childbirth, followed shortly after by her infant child. In her honour and to show his support for Pompey in his grief, Caesar organised a massive banquet in remembrance of his daughter. Such funeral feasts, known as a novendialis, traditionally took place on the ninth day after a person had died, marking the end the full period of official mourning. Caesar was likely campaigning in Gaul at that time, according to some sources, such as Seneca, possibly in Britannia, so it is likely that this banquet supplemented the traditional rites of the novendialis at a later date."

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_aesthetics_doric_order"	"In classical architecture, the uniform assembly of constituent parts according to established proportions is called an ‘order’. There are five main architectural orders, three of which were created in ancient Greece; Doric, Ionic, and the later Corinthian. Doric order, originating on the western mainland during the Archaic Period, is the oldest and most functional of the three; short, fluted columns and plain round tops without a base plinth. Proportionally, Doric order has shorter, thicker columns than those designed in the Ionic style, giving a more ‘masculine’ look which had a bearing on the type of building it was used for. A surviving example is the marble Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, to the northwest of the hill housing the city’s ancient agora, or marketplace."	"True"

Consisting of slender, more ‘feminine’ pillars than those of the Doric style, often with more fluting and ornate detail at the top. Crucially, the shaft of the columns must be eight times the diameter of its narrowest point.

"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_civil_diplomacy_african_mission"	"It was always Hannibal's intention to utilise brute-force diplomacy as he campaigned across the Italian peninsula, hoping to break down the Roman alliances with the Socii and implode the Republic. However, the plan did not unfurl as intended and, as Carthage began to lose ground in the conflict, it completely backfired. The Massylii, a Numidian tribe, had been present at some of the greatest Carthaginian victories of the war, their superb mounted skirmisher cavalry being key to Hannibal's tactical success in many of them. When his fortunes began to sour, however, and after the death of the tribe's pro-Carthaginian leader, they defected to the Romans. Diplomatic overtures from Scipio to the new leader, Masinissa, further greased the wheels of this new alliance."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_syracuse_engineering_siege_torsion_power"	"It was the ancient Greeks who originally developed torsion siege engines, such as the onager and ballista, to smash through city walls and allow their troops to assault the breach. Although versions that used tension power had been in use for many years, torsion engines came into use around the beginning of the 4th century BC, and were probably invented by the Greek scientist Dionysius the Elder of Syracuse. However, these powerful weapons came to the fore and were used extensively during the Second Punic War, particularly for besieging large cities. During the conflict and following its defection to Hannibal's cause, the city of Syracuse was besieged by Rome, holding out for two years before falling. Although, ironically, Greek torsion technology aided the Romans in their successful completion of the siege, it was the mathematical genius of the inventor Archimedes that helped the Syracusan forces to hold out for as long as they did."

In their heyday they were the epitome of everything that made steppe nomads into effective fighting men and superb cavalrymen. No one was their equal in the saddle. Civilised Greek writers such as Herodotus criticised them for being “barbarous and cruel", but civilised men were perfectly willing to hire them as mercenaries for their barbarous skills.

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_philosopphy_ostracism"	"Like many Greek practises (such as cynical philosophy), ostracism has warped slightly in meaning for contemporary understanding. Yet the modern interpretation is not so far removed from its use in antiquity. In simple terms, ostracism in Athenian democracy was the expulsion, by popular vote, of any citizen for a decade. It was used both as a punishment but, more often, as a pre-emptive measure to stop would-be tyrants, and any threats to the state. Ostracism takes its name from 'ostraka', which were pieces of pottery upon which the name of the candidate was written. Pottery was by far more abundant than paper at this time, so fragments were often used as ballot chips. Each year, the Athenian assembly was asked if they wished to ostracise anyone, with the event itself occurring two months after. In typical democratic style, the candidate with the most votes (over a minimum threshold of 6,000) would be banished. Interestingly, this was not a legal process, simply a democratic one. No trial was held, and no defence could be mounted; when the votes were cast, whoever had the most was, simply, exiled."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_aesthetics_red_figure_painting"	"Like most nations in antiquity, the Hellenic states keenly practised the art of pottery-making, and it is from this that we are able to obtain the clearest picture of ancient life. The Greeks chiefly used two art styles on their wares; Black Figure and Red Figure. The earlier of the two was Black Figure pottery, which depicted people and figures in black against a red background. Red Figure pottery inverts that, putting the figures in red against primarily dark backgrounds, drawing a more severe contrast from a darker negative space. The transition from Black to Red (around 530BC) also accompanied a trend towards more serious depictions; situations cast on vases and pottery were given more context and, in doing so, pathos. The art of figures also altered, recalling an earlier time; the slender, lithe figures exuded a sense of divinity and serenity, belying the artist's focus on balance, harmony and symmetry. One of the most well-known pottery artists of this period is Hermonax, who painted from 470 to 440BC, and is known for his inscriptions, which always stated: "Hermonax has painted it"."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_military_navy_liturgy"	"Literally translating as ‘work for the people’, liturgy, or ‘leitourgia’ referred to the financial commitments made by wealthy Greeks to their home city-state. These would often take the form of sponsorship of games or religious festivals, but also building and military projects. Although such contributions were expected and often mandatory, liturgy was rewarded with public offices and improved status for the individual concerned. During the time of the Persian and Peloponnesian Wars, ‘trierarchy’ – the construction, equipment and manning of a fighting trireme for a period of one year – was a common form of liturgy. The benefactor, known as the ‘trierarch’, might also be expected to command the ship under the direction of the overall ‘strategos’ for the campaign. However, it was possible for a trierarch to avoid direct involvement by payment of an additional stipend to employ a specialist admiral to command in his stead."	"True"

In exchange for Phraates’ son, Augustus and the Senate were able to secure the return of the Eagles that had been lost at the disastrous Battle of Carrhae some thirty-three years earlier."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_military_management_chariotry"	"Nisean horses were famed for their speed and beauty, making them the most sought after and expensive steeds in the ancient world. The Persians held them as sacred and limited their use to the nobility; two grey Nisean stallions pulled the royal chariot.

Without fixed cities to defend or attack, it was mobility that won battles and the fast raid that proved profitable in terms of plunder. These tactics were ideal for attacks on settled, so-called civilised neighbours too. The tribe, then, that mastered mobility and the correct use of horses in battle was the tribe that flourished. Equally importantly, it was vital to be able to move the whole people as one with the minimum of fuss. Everyone, from the youngest child to the oldest grandmother, understood their part in moving the tribe and everything that it possessed. Without such skills, the best grazing would be taken by others and the herds would starve."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_pel_military_support_thessalian_tactics"	"Of all the Greeks, the Thessalians were considered to be the very best riders available. This isn’t surprising, as the central region of Thessaly, with its rolling plains, was abundant with large, fine horses - ideal for use in war. This caused the human population to naturally gravitate towards husbandry and horsemanship. They were also incredibly warlike, believing themselves descended from Herakles; their almost-feudal society, ruled by kings from the leading Thessalian noble families, dominated its neighbours. Like the larger Macedon to the north, Thessaly’s terrain made it an ideal cavalry training ground. As a result, cavalry became an integral part of the Thessalian martial way and gave them a distinct advantage over many of their opponents. Thessalian horsemen were a daunting prospect to face, their (at the time) innovative use of a rhomboid or diamond formation enabled them to smash through the rear and flanks of enemy phalanxes, causing death and disorder that was difficult for such a tightly-packed unit to recover from."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_management_supply_reforms"	"Of all the reforms that the later Republican Roman army introduced, the one that probably caused the most grumbling in the ranks was getting the men to carry their supplies and equipment. The semi-joking name of 'Marius’ mules' given to legionaries was not a reflection on their stubbornness, but on the large amount of gear they were expected to shoulder and carry while on the march. The result was the Legions didn’t have a huge baggage train of slaves, servants and carts; the soldiers were largely their own baggage train. Legionaries also ate like pigs before a campaign. Fat legionaries were not unfit; they were ready for a long hard march into enemy lands, and were looked on favourably by their centurions. It was far easier to carry extra rations as body-fat inside the men. They would still eat on campaign, but they would have reserves to carry them through any days of short rations or poor foraging. This might make all the difference to victory or defeat if the enemy were clever enough to be burning everything in their path. After a few weeks of marching and conquest the legionaries would have burned through their fat and be back to fighting weight. They would also be hungry, and unforgiving to the enemy!"	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_mathematics_indoor_plumbing"	"One of the lasting legacies of the ancient Greeks (and later the Romans) is their pioneering work in the fields of sanitation and water supply. Rome, in particular, is famed for its aqueducts (such as Pont du Gard) whilst the ancient Cretan Greeks were the first to make underground clay pipes to supply water and funnel sewage away. Indoor plumbing, however, was more of a rarity during the Hellenic age. Most simply had servants pour water over their heads as a form of rudimentary shower. However, the ancient Greeks eventually devised the first real showers, in the gymnasiums, with water pumped in from outside to spray down through ornate showerheads. In many ways, they were virtually indistinguishable from contemporary showers, replete with drains for the water and grime to wash away into."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_military_management_supply_chain"	"Over the centuries the Roman army became renowned for its superior grasp of logistics. Its use of supply lines was highly developed - the troops carried what they needed with them and foraged for the rest as they marched. It was during the Second Punic War that supply lines became the crux of Roman strategy, however. Hannibal, although decimating any Roman force he encountered in pitched battle, was marching deep into enemy territory with only the most tenuous line of supply back to Iberia. On the other hand, Rome was able to create a network that kept its Legions supplied whilst denying Hannibal that same luxury."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_engineering_siege_reinforced_artillery"	"Over the course of the Second Punic War, as Hannibal campaigned through Italy, it became apparent that confronting him in a pitched battle was far too dangerous an undertaking. Although it wounded Roman pride at the time, Quintus Fabius Maximus' strategy of avoiding direct confrontation in favour of harrying and slowly whittling the enemy forces down gradually came to be seen as the most prudent course of action. Therefore, having strong artillery with which to harass the Carthaginian army from afar had obvious advantages. The thinking was that slowly destroying Hannibal's forces would affect their morale as well as their number, as there is nothing so demoralising as being unable to face an attacking enemy in open combat."

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_philosopphy_education"	"Pedagogy is the art of education, focusing on the teaching of the young and their fostering into adulthood. It is derived from the Greek word 'paidagogia' which means 'child' (paidos) and 'lead' (ago) - so 'to lead the child'. In antiquity, societies such as the Socratic Circles applied the philosophies and ideas of Socrates in a pedagogical way, encouraging the enlightenment of youth through discussion and discourse, as opposed to learning as fait accompli. Greek society also practiced 'paideia', which was designed to mould children into ideal members of the polis - the 'beautiful and good' - and nurture the aristocratic class. Pedagogy and paideai (and also the Greek concept of pederasty) all feed into the classical Greek notions of beauty and focus on aesthetics."	"True"

According to Plato, they were the abstract blueprint ideas of reality, the essence of objects - any objects; people, dogs, trees etc. - and distinct from 'matter' - the objects themselves. Much like Socrates suggested that the Idea is the highest form of reason and wisdom, Plato wrote that the form is the highest measure of a 'thing', and that physical reality is simply a shade - an imperfect copy - of the form. It is impossible for the reality to be as perfect as the form.

In it, Pytheas apparently described the colder climate and phenomena of the midnight sun, indicating that he sailed to the Arctic Circle.

"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_civil_diplomacy_diplomats"	"Romans took their laws very seriously, believing themselves to be the supreme arbiters of political and administrative elegance. The concept of diplomacy, descended from ancient Greek ideals, fitted neatly into the framework of Roman political dealing. As the Republic expanded into an empire, so too did the scale of their diplomatic dealings. Foreign policy was conducted by the Senate, and envoys were given lavish welcoming ceremonies. The success of Roman diplomacy, on the other hand, is a matter of some contention. As a state profiting from aggressive expansion, their diplomacy often seemed at best a formality, and at worst salt in the wound."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_roman_civil_philosophy_physicians"	"Rome and Greece produced some of the finest physicians in the ancient world, most notably Galen, who first learnt his trade treating gladiators and later became personal physician to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

Galen followed the principles of the great Greek physician Hippocrates, in that he believed the human condition was based on the balance of four 'humours': yellow bile, black bile, phlegm and blood. It was thought that illness was caused by an excess or deficiency in any one of these humours, a theory that went unquestioned until the 16th century."	"True"

The battles of Lake Trasimene, Trebia and the slaughter at Cannae forced the state to alter its tactics to outsmart Hannibal, such was his ingenuity on the battlefield. The Roman general Scipio first took Hannibal's own tactical style and appropriated it to counter Hannibal's brother Mago Barca and Hasdrubal Gisco in Iberia. At Ilipa, Scipio reversed the crescent manoeuvre used against Rome at Cannae to devastating effect, having tricked the Carthaginians into the wrong formation. Although bad weather allowed a temporary reprieve, their attempt to retreat led to an all-out massacre which shattered Barcid power in Iberia. Later, Scipio confounded Hannibal at Zama, just outside Carthage itself, with his advanced tactics, in what turned out to be the conclusive battle of the conflict. A clever manoeuvre meant that some of the Hannibal's elephants were channelled away and others forced back through the Carthaginian lines before Scipio's superior Roman infantry advanced against them, causing a rout."

"technologies_long_description_pel_military_navy_flute_coordination"	"Rowing a boat alone is difficult enough for one person to manage; when there are dozens of oarsmen, dragging a warship through the water in unison, this problem is multiplied. In order to facilitate the synchronous pull of the oars, triremes carried on-board a piper - or 'auletes' - who would play to keep the rowers in time using the 'aulos' - a simple flute. The instrument was also known as the kalamos or libykos lotos - 'Libyan lotus' - a reference to the materials used to make it. One of the most commonly played instruments in Greece, it was used for performances of tragedy, at social occasions and at private drinking parties, as well as for military purposes."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_aesthetics_momumental_sculpturing"	"Sculpture in ancient Greece was chiefly concerned with depicting the glory of battle, the magnificence of mythology, and the brilliance of Greek rulers. The earliest Greek sculptures were made of wood, though none remain today. From the Classical Period onwards, almost all sculptures were made of marble and bronze, though a more elaborate method, known as Chryselephantine, was used for ornate filigree decorations of gold and ivory. One of the most impressive examples of Greek monumental sculpture is the Apollon of Olympia, part of a depiction of the mythical Battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs. Apollo, young and beautiful, stands pointing with accusation, though he is largely ignored by the other warriors. The Elgin Marbles, a set of frieze reliefs from the Acropolis of Athens, depict the same battle on a grand scale, representing one of the greatest surviving examples of the art."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_illyrian_military_warrior_code_spear_training"	"Several centuries of conflict with their Greek and Macedonian neighbours led the Illyrians to adopt much of their enemies' martial acumen and tactical skill. The old-fashioned heroic charge, favoured by barbarian cultures throughout the world along with the traditional warrior-hero ethos, was gradually replaced by a more Hellenistic order of battle, eschewing individual heroism for mass action as part of a hoplite phalanx. This required the Illyrians to learn a different way of fighting. Traditionally, spears were for throwing; the individual hurled a spear or some javelins before charging into battle to engage the enemy with his deadly sica sword. Now, it was to be used as a thrusting weapon whilst part of a tightly-packed body of men all fighting as one. Eventually, this new spear training proved highly successful, leading to a brief conquest of neighbouring Epirus and even the defeat of the regional Hellenic super-power, Macedon, under the aging Illyrian king, Bardyllis."

"technologies_long_description_rom_pontus_military_navy_kataphract_ships"	"Ship design in the Hellenistic era was advanced by the eastern Successor states. Pontus, on the Black Sea and reliant on sea trade, required a strong navy to protect its interests. Developed from the Greek trireme, ships were improved by adding more banks of rowers. Ships also got bigger, and increased in both length and beam, but at a cost in speed; this allowed larger marine contingents to be carried. Quinqueremes were common from the 4th century BC and featuring rows of five oarsmen, but in the east colossal '20s' and '40s' were constructed. These were usually two hulls in a catamaran arrangement with a fighting platform between them."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_military_navy_crew_synchronization"	"Ships used for ramming actions during ancient sea battles were specifically designed and constructed for the purpose. Ramming was a surprisingly exacting business, and required timing and judgement on the part of the commander as well as speed, efficiency, and synchronised activity from his crew. It was also important that crew numbers were kept to a minimum to ensure manoeuvrability and that the ship was travelling at exactly the right speed – not too quickly or too slowly. If it came in too slowly the enemy could, in most cases, easily back out of the way, yet too much speed could result in the ram becoming stuck fast in the enemy hull. If a first attempt proved inconclusive and a second was necessary, the crew of the ramming ship had to frantically back up to try again; if they were unable to detach the vessel from its target it would be vulnerable to counter-attack."

"technologies_long_description_rom_syracuse_engineering_construction_golden_age"	"Syracusan history was defined by a steady stream of 'tyrants' - dictatorial leaders who rejected traditional Greek democracy in favour of a form of kingship. Amongst the most notable tyrants was Hiero II, who seized control of the city-state following the departure from Sicily of the Hellenistic king Pyrrhus of Epirus in 275BC. Made king in 270BC following his successful campaign against the marauding Mamertines of Messana, Hiero II ruled for an incredible sixty years, and proved a fair and popular ruler who led Syracuse through many prosperous years - the 'golden age' of its history. During his reign the city was expanded, including the creation of the huge 'Altar of Hieron' and the further development of its great theatre. Although initially allied to Carthage at the outbreak of the First Punic War, the king eventually made peace and was made a 'friend of Rome'. However, upon Hiero's death in 215BC his successor, Hieronymous, broke his longstanding treaties and once again aligned Syracuse with Carthage, which very soon led to its downfall at Roman hands. Following their annexation of the city, the Romans adopted Hiero II's taxation system, which became known as the Lex Hieronica."	"True"

Forcing the Roman army to take a track which led between a bog to the north and woodland to the south, the Germanic tribes constructed earth walls, allowing them to fire down on the Romans from cover. After failing to storm them, the Roman cavalry fled, leaving the remaining troops to the mercy of the tribesmen now swarming over the walls. This carefully planned attack convinced the Romans that the Germanic tribes were a force to be reckoned with; after Teutoburg Forest they gave up their dream of conquering the lands north of the Rhine."

"technologies_long_description_rom_syracuse_military_navy_block_and_pulley_system"	"The block and pulley was a system of two or more wheels on an axle - the pulley - with cable threaded between them. The pulleys were then assembled in pairs or blocks; one then moves with the load, whilst the other stays still. In this way the mechanism did most of the work, using leverage to relieve the stress on its users. This  allowed sailors to lift objects far too heavy for them, improving the cargo capacity and therefore efficiency of shipping. The variation on the block and pulley - or tackle - system used at Syracuse was designed by the well-known Greek inventor Archimedes (287-212BC), credited with many useful inventions during his lifetime and now considered to be the most important mathematician of the ancient world."

When it was placed around the rim, and allowed to cool, it shrank and bound the wheel’s components together. This was then further fixed to the wheel with large-headed nails that gave extra grip to the iron tyre."	"True"

Long before, the Carthaginians had sent diplomats to broker an alliance with the unhappy Gauls, using mutual hatred of Rome as their bargaining chip.

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_aesthetics_greek_classical_art"	"The classical period of Greek history saw a surge in the arts, brought on by confidence and strength in Athens following its victory over the invading Persians. The aftermath of the Persian war allowed Athens and its would-be empire to consolidate, an environment in which people were able to express their culture more prominently. The first democracy, though primitive, burgeoned in the Athenian government, which put an elite class of thinkers, inventors and artists in positions of power. From this well sprang a wealth of poets producing new types of theatre - comedy and tragedy - which examined the human condition and social issues of the day more keenly. At the same time, having the learned in a stronger position meant that philosophy and the arts collided, as schools of rationalism discussed the human form. The wealthy still became patrons, and the vast swathe of pottery and paintings produced were commissioned either for individuals or by the state to create edifices to history, such as the commemoration of the climactic Battle of Marathon."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_military_top"	"The concept of the Greek city-state – or ‘polis’ - was born from the Archaic Period, when tribal groups and families banded together into ‘civilised’ communities for mutual protection, self-governance and autonomy. Naturally, as remains the case in modern society, everyone who lived within a polis had to justify his place within its walls and his share of the food and benefits city living provided. Free men of the ‘middle class’ and above – those who were skilled artisans or owners of property - were expected to take part in politics and provide military service in return for their citizenship. As the state did not provide equipment for its soldiers, only those who could afford the necessary bronze armour and weapons required for such service were eligible for conscription during times of war. This meant that the poor were exempted - although this probably had as much to do with the fact that they carried out the menial tasks no one else wanted to do, making military service a prestigious privilege as well as a duty."

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_philosopphy_cunism_philsophy"	"The contemporary definition of cynicism is a distrust of others and, generally, a chronically fatalistic outlook on life. In antiquity, however, the concept of cynical philosophy was quite different. Cynical philosophers promoted the idea of harmony with nature and reality. They called for a rejection of all man-made wealth and powers, eschewing the desire for fame and sex, and living a life free of materialism. A student of Socrates, Antisthenes, is credited with being the first cynical philosopher, but he was soon followed by others, perhaps most radically by Diogenes, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. As antiquity faded and passed, cynical philosophy focused too much on the negative aspects of humanity, soon giving way to its modern interpretation, as rejecting materialism shone a light on the inherent greed and amorality of the human condition."

"technologies_long_description_rom_roman_military_navy_corvus"	"The corvus, or 'raven', was a spiked grappling bridge which could be swung out from a ship's bow and lowered onto the deck of enemy vessels, allowing marines to assault and seize the target ship. Invented by the Romans, the corvus enabled them to compete with enemies who boasted superior mastery of the seas and, most notably, the Carthaginians. It was first used in the Battle of Mylae in 260BC, when the over-confident Carthaginians sailed towards their enemy, only to have the first thirty ships captured by the Romans. The rest of the Carthaginian fleet soon took flight but not before fifty ships were lost due to Roman engineering ingenuity."	"True"

Following the climactic Battle of Salamis, in which he fought, Cimon set about recapturing former Greek territory in Asia Minor from the Persians. Knowing that he was greatly outnumbered by the Persian navy, Cimon had 200 hundred triremes constructed to be not only swift and manoeuvrable, but also broader and with improved access. This enabled them to carry many more hoplite marines than was previously the case. Despite their numbers, the Greeks would achieve victory by boarding and capture, overwhelming the Persian ships with sheer numbers."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_mathematics_golden_ratio"	"The Golden Ratio or Golden Section is a mathematical expression of proportion, explicitly two numbers whose ratio to each other is equal to the ratio of their sum to the larger number of the two. An expression of pure mathematics, and one that aptly demonstrates its direct influence on the physical world, the Golden Ratio has fascinated many thinkers over the last 2,400 years. The Greeks first noticed it as a result of their studies of geometry; for instance, it was observed in the proportions of Phidias’ statues inside the Parthenon in Athens in 432BC. The first recorded definition of the Golden Ratio appears in Euclid’s ‘Elements’, almost one hundred years later, in which he refers to the proportions as an “extreme and mean ratio”, noting that “as the whole line is to the greater segment, so is the greater to the lesser”. He goes on to demonstrate the Ratio’s presence in several subsequent theorems and proofs."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_philosopphy_socratic_philosophy"	"The history of the philosopher Socrates is shrouded in mystery. As he did not document any of his teachings or philosophies we have learned most of what we know of him from his 'best disciple', Plato, through his philosophical or dramatic texts. This has become known as the 'Socratic Problem', as disentangling the real Socrates from Plato's more vivacious accounts of him is almost impossible. However, what we do know about is Socrates' approach to dialogue and philosophy, creating the 'Socratic Method'. The Socratic Method seeks to unveil truth through sustained discussion as a means of eliminating hypotheses - focused criticism on a posited argument reveals inaccuracies and contradictions that may prove them false. The method looks for consistency across all things, and considers those theories that maintain consistencies to be ultimate truths. Socrates' teachings feed back into the ultimate quest for knowledge and truth, or epistemology, which was the cornerstone of Hellenic philosophy."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_civil_laws_lex_minucia"	"The Lex Minucia, passed in 216BC, created a new Senatorial Triumvirate of 'mensarii'. As opposed to 'argentarii', who did business on their own private accounts, the mensarii were a committee of public bankers who were licensed to lend public money in exchange for 'security to the state'. This meant that, essentially, the Republic itself was owed the money, and if debtors defaulted on their payments Rome would take control of their assets as reparation. The new law was a measure specifically designed for raising funds during times of state crisis, and the Second Punic War particularly, when it was used extensively to pay for the ongoing, and increasingly desperate, struggle against Hannibal."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pun_roman_civil_laws_lex_oppia"	"The Lex Oppia was passed in 215BC, shortly after Rome's catastrophic defeat by Hannibal at Cannae. The new law not only restricted a woman's wealth but the display of that wealth also. It specifically forbade females from owning more than half an ounce of gold, to dress in any purple-trimmed or coloured garments, and to ride horse-drawn vehicles. At the time, it was thought that ostentatious displays of private wealth might promote greed and corruption within the Republic, subverting the values of society at a time when they mattered the most. Lex Oppia was later repealed in 195BC, after the eventual defeat of Carthage in the Second Punic War."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_engineering_construction_improved_material_transportation"	"The location, and scale, of building projects was influenced by a number of factors, not least availability of building materials. Quarrying techniques improved, and the transportation of materials became easier, thanks to a vast network of canals. Improved carts and wagons helped to improve overland transport, as did the introduction of safe trade routes. However, land routes remained more expensive and physically demanding than their water equivalents, and waterways became the favoured method of material transportation."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_rom_illyrian_military_war_exercises_infantry_tactics"	"The natural spread of Hellenic culture due to the Illyrians' geographical proximity to the western Greek city-states and Macedon, along with centuries of warfare between their two cultures, ensured the Illyrians learned much from their city-dwelling neighbours. Gradually, their uncoordinated but brutally aggressive barbarian charge was transformed into the highly effective spear phalanx favoured by the Greeks. Learning the 'hoplite' fighting style took practice and drill; the solid mass of spearpoints had to be kept tight, each man learning to hold his position and balance so he could fight effectively. Furthermore, the phalanx had to move steadily as one and its weaker right-wing had to be protected against flanking manoeuvres from lighter enemy units. The Illyrian phalanx eventually became a force to be reckoned with. In 359BC, under their warrior-king, Bardyllis, it even defeated the mighty Macedonian war machine."	"True"

However, it is known that the first Greek drama to be labelled as a 'tragedy' was staged during the festival of Dionysia in 534BC. The actor, Thespis, was the first man to play a part, instead of speaking as himself, which was until then the standard. Most Greek tragedies begin with a prologue to set the scene, before moving into an opening song. After this, the story begins and unfolds episodically, broken up by more songs. The play concludes with an 'exodus' of the players as they leave the stage. The tragedies, according to Aristotle, were a form of catharsis, born out of a "noble and complete" action (the play itself) so that the viewer may "purify their passions"."	"True"

The strength of a crop was affected by the seed from which it was grown and through seed selection a farmer could develop a crop free of disease that offered a more profitable yield. The farmer had to take the time to select only seeds from the most healthy and strong plants in a crop, removing the small, withered, discoloured or inferior seeds. Selecting the seed was usually simple: the best seed was the heaviest, and would therefore be found settled on the very bottom of the grain on the threshing floor."	"True"

Armed with 'pila' or javelins, they were backed by a second row of 'principes', men in the prime of their life who were formidable enough to close any battle for the Romans. They too were armed with pila as well as a sword for close combat. Behind this rank of men, the 'triarii' would wait.

The Legion was formed up as thirty compact blocks of men or 'maniples', deployed in a 'chessboard' formation. The 'hastati', made up of the youngest men, were the first to engage the enemy. Armed with 'pila' or javelins, they were backed by a second row of 'principes', men in the prime of their life who were formidable enough to close any battle for the Romans. They too were armed with pila as well as a sword for close combat. Behind this rank of men, the 'triarii' would wait.

Epistemology' is primarily concerned with facts - the unchangeable knowledge of truth, as opposed to the science of why and how. In antiquity, the questions of fact and knowledge were pondered by many Greek scholars, including Plato and Socrates. Plato believed that ideas were the highest form of knowledge, and as such were fundamental realities. All ideas, according to Plato, lie dormant within us and so, when we learn something new, we are in fact simply summoning up something we already know deep down inside. Although a controversial and bizarre notion, Plato also drew a clear definition between knowledge, which he agreed was certain fundamental fact, and opinion which, although potentially true, was subjective and untrustworthy.

"technologies_long_description_pel_military_navy_waterproof_leather"	"The trireme - the most common warship in the Greco-Roman world - was the apex of ancient technology. Reinforced prows for ramming made them formidable naval weapons, especially when dragged through the waves by three rows of oarsmen, interlaced but layered, with two levels stacked along the gunwales whilst the third set of rowers were below deck. A problem arose, however, when the ship tilted or was in particularly choppy conditions; as the lower oarsmen were only eighteen inches from the water level it was very easy for it to get in. To combat this, a leather bag known as an 'askoma' was fitted snugly around the oarholes to prevent water from entering the ship. In times of extreme turbulence the oars could be retracted altogether and the askoma sealed."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_pel_military_navy_binding_wires"	"The trireme was the chief warship of the ancient world, used in great numbers by the Phoenicians, Romans and Greeks. Although evidence of their design and construction is extremely limited, the knowledge that they lasted approximately twenty years indicates they were built with care and diligence, despite pushing classical technology to its limits. The trireme was exposed to staggeringly punishing conditions on the waves and in battle. One method that was devised by Athenians to help their vessels cope was the use of 'hypozomata', or binding wires. These were thick cables rigged under the hull (a process known as 'frapping') and drawn taught to help brace the ship, particularly when ramming. Hypozomata were considered a state secret in Athens, and exporting them was considered a capital offense."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_aesthetics_acting"	"Theatre and dramatic culture first emerged in ancient Athens around 700BC, yet the culture flourished in the 5th century BC, when the festival of Dionysia - in which the god of wine and ecstasy, Dionysus, was idolised and celebrated - was formalised. The festival's chief events were performances of tragedies from 532BC and comedies from 487BC. It is through Dionysus' increase in popularity that we see the rise in distinctive ancient theatres, from those at Delphi and Epidaurus (which was famed for its amazing acoustics) all the way to the majestic Theatre of Syracuse (which was heralded in the 2nd century BC as the greatest theatre in the world and the birthplace of comedy). Several traditions manifested themselves in Greek theatre, such as the use of ornately decorated masks, from where we get the two-masked icon of drama, as well as more complex stage machinery like cranes, which enabled actors to fly, and trap doors for dramatic entrances and exits from the stage."

"technologies_long_description_pel_civics_mathematics_acoustics"	"Theatres in the ancient world adequate sound was a sizeable problem. In the large, sloped spaces the issue of how to get sound to travel from the stage to the furthest seats was a constant problem. However, the Theatre of Epidaurus was renowned for the excellence of its acoustics - people at the back could hear the action of the stage as clear as someone in the front row. Yet the creation of such beautiful acoustics happened entirely by accident; the limestone seats used dampened low-frequency noise (such as shuffling or the murmuring of the crowd) and amplified high-frequency sounds (such as the bombastic voices of the actors on stage), carrying the entertainment all the way to the back row. Many attempts were made to recreate Epidaurus' acoustics, but no other theatre in the ancient world quite achieved the same sonic superiority."	"True"

It was the Syracusans who made the first steps towards creating artillery pieces that could be used at sea. They designed a contraption known as the 'gastraphetes' or 'belly bow'. This oversized composite bow rested on the stomach of its user and was pulled back when braced by his feet. It could fire a substantial bolt some fifty yards further than a regular bow.

"technologies_long_description_rom_dacian_engineering_construction_murus_dacius"	"Utilising modern building techniques borrowed from their 'civilised' Hellenic neighbours, in combination with the traditional skills and building methods of their own people, the Dacians developed a unique formula for defensive wall construction. Known to the Romans as 'Murus Dacicus', the walls consisted of rows of stone blocks, cut into rhomboid shapes, with compacted clay, small rocks and aggregate used to fill the space between them. At regular intervals beams of wood were laid at right angles in order to provide the structure with further strength. A wooden palisade or stone battlement was added to the top, from which to shelter from and fire missiles at a besieging force. Although no mortar was used, this clever, yet time and labour-intensive method ensured the walls were extremely strong, yet far more flexible than those built using traditional dry-stone construction techniques. This, in turn, meant they had greater capacity for absorbing the shock of missiles fired from siege weapons."	"True"

Small engravings of gods and myths on rings and necklaces were common, as were tablets and pottery bearing religious dedications.

"technologies_long_description_pun_carthage_civil_diplomacy_iberian_supremacy"	"When Hamilcar Barca established himself in Iberia, he did it as much to gain glory for his nation as he did to get away from it. Acting largely autonomously, he never returned to Carthage and had proxies speak for him in the senate. The Iberians respected powerful rulers and, on Hamilcar's death, his son-in-law, Hasdrubal the Fair - so named after his preference for diplomacy over conflict - was established as leader in Iberia. Upon Hasdrubal's death in 221BC Hamilcar's now 26 year-old son, Hannibal, succeeded him - without the consent of the Council of Elders back in Carthage. Hannibal was acclaimed 'Strategos Autokratos' by his Iberian army, such was his military skill and aptitude for the task ahead. This is a Greek term linking him to the Hellenistic legends that came before him - Alexander, Pyrrhus and the Syracusan tyrants - and embodying a form of dictatorship that defined Hannibal as far more than a mere general."

Rome was able to swiftly mobilise two armies in response, which went on to intercept and defeat Hasdrubal's relief force. Although in their first encounter the Carthaginians were able to elude total destruction, the remains of Hasdrubal's army were soon pinned down once again by the pursuing Roman Legions and, this time, decisively defeated at the Metaurus in 207BC. This greatly weakened Hannibal's war effort as well as being a great blow to his personal morale. Hasdrubal himself was killed in action on the battlefield; his severed head was sent to Hannibal by the victorious Romans - a completely different kind of message to the one he was expecting."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_rom_dlc_gaul_celtic_politics_people_3_confederation"	"When the Eburones were exterminated at Caesar’s command, anti-Roman sentiment was rife in Gaul. This was especially true amongst the lower orders, which gained little from the pro-Roman aristocracies that ruled them. It was in this political climate that Vercingetorix of the Arverni was able to orchestrate a rebellion against Rome. After defeating the naysayers who had expelled him from his own tribe at their capital, Gergovia, Vercingetorix forged the Gallic tribes into a loose confederation, appointing himself king and supreme commander of their armies in the process. Held together by a shared hatred of the Romans, as well as Vercingetorix’s strict rule and hostage-taking to ensure loyalty, the tribes turned against Caesar en masse."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_rom_nomad_civil_tribal_economy_organised_craft_working"	"While raiding and plunder had their place, the surer road to riches was trade with neighbouring peoples. Even the warlike Scythians noticed that their goods and crafts found a ready market among civilised folk, and that trade could bring wealth with considerably less risk than robbery. Indeed, craftwork became organised on a relatively large scale; while there was nothing equivalent to a large, modern factory, the scale of production achieved by many craftsmen working together could be quite impressive. It was not quite an industrial revolution, but it helped to bring wealth to the Scythians and cement their social order."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_rom_dlc_gaul_celtic_politics_people_3_tribal_cooperation"	"With a shared cultural background and, at times, goals that were aligned, co-operation between Gallic tribes was common. Many of the larger ones were owed fealty by their clients, often because of blood ties, conquest, or in exchange for protection or wealth. This co-operation could be fragile, however, especially in the face of enemies such as Rome or the Germanic tribes. When the Arverni allied with the Sequani and the Germanic Suebi to crush their rivals, the Rome-backed Aedui, the Arverni had no qualms leaving their allies to bear the brunt of the growing Suebian demands for land east of the Rhine."

"technologies_long_description_rom_eastern_civil_agriculture_terraced_fields"	"With an ongoing struggle to collect and harness water supplies to irrigate their fields in arid climates, eastern civilisations turned to terracing in order to utilise land on hills and mountainsides. Narrow fields, formed as steps in the sloping land, allowed hillsides to be farmed with little risk of soil erosion. Each step, or field, was irrigated by a network of canals. In Mesopotamia, terraced fields were irrigated by a network of 'shadufs' which were placed on each step. This simple ancient water-lifting device was made up of a large beam, supporting a rope and bucket, with a counter weight at the opposite end."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_culture_establish_ennaree_council"	"The Enaree was a mystic figure within Scythian tribes, a shaman described by the historian Herodotus as 'androgynous'. They venerated nature and used tree bark to foresee future events, which meant that the Enaree shamans were probably feared by ordinary folk but extremely important to the chieftain. For example, recruiting warriors for a raid might be ruined by an Enaree's prediction of failure. In turn, this means that chieftains were willing to support their shamans in order that they might proclaim favourable omens."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_culture_gather_ennaree_shamans"	"'Enarees' were Scythian shamans, often described as epicene or androgynous. Their effeminacy was considered divine, as well as hereditary, afflicting them and all their descendants with a 'female' sickness. Enaree shamanism involved falling into a state of religious ecstasy by consuming certain herbs or mushrooms. In this spiritual euphoria they performed divination using wands made from willow trees. They also practiced ritual tattooing, using gold-covered iron needles and bone spoons to blend paints."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_culture_gather_royal_storytellers"	"The barbarian peoples did not record their history, relying instead on individual memory and word of mouth to preserve significant events and famous deeds. Bards were poets and storytellers who sang songs recalling feats of bravery and heroism, as well as lineages and family histories of nobles and the ruling household. A bard could enchant his audience with his voice, raising their spirits and morale. Chieftains and nobles often employed these singers to provide entertainment during large feasts. Thus, they had a higher status in the tribe's warrior society. In order to preserve their tales, bards had apprentices to whom they passed on their poems and songs. The Romans despised barbarian bards, not just as savages, but as the main obstacle to Romanisation, since their songs prevented tribes from conforming to Roman ideals. Eventually, however, during the early 4th century AD, a massive surge in the adoption and popularity of Christianity led to the decline of the bard's relevance."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_culture_invoke_blood_ties"	"In the 2nd century AD, migrating Germanic tribes such as the Marcomanni and Quadi advanced to the Roman frontier along the Danube river, causing the Marcomannic Wars. Not long after, barbarians started banding together, forming large confederations led by chieftains with similar powers to kings. Traditional tribal life was slowly abandoned in favour of centralised rule. The peoples still retained their unique clan identities, however, but ultimately listened to the most charismatic chieftains. On the surface, Rome saw this as a positive development, since the Romans would prefer to deal with a few authority figures who controlled the alarming amount of warriors living just across the Rhine and Danube. Unfortunately, the confederations amplified Germanic power and Roman soldiers were generally not too keen on friendly relations with the barbarians. The Roman Emperor Severus Alexander was killed by his own troops in AD 235 for negotiating peace through diplomacy and bribery with the Germanic tribes against his army's wishes."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_culture_pay_respect_ancestors"	"After death, a nomadic king or prominent warrior would be buried in a great mound, known as a 'kurgan', along with his many earthly possessions. These would almost invariably include the weapons of the deceased, although some burials are known to have included his steeds or even his battle chariot. Such a funeral must have involved a lot of people, probably every able person in the tribe, judging by the size of the mounds and the contents of the chambers within. Participating in the construction and the ceremony was believed to be a way to gain the favour of the hero who had departed to the afterlife. This favour could be retained by regularly paying respects at the tomb."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_culture_restore_scythian_traditions"	"The Alani tribes probably belonged to a steppe people known as the Scythians. Different from barbarian savages, they carried ancient nomadic culture based on the traditions of the royal Scythian tribes from the cold northern regions. The Scythians were more interested in art and preserving their ways than the barbarians of Europe - both men and women wore long-sleeved robes with ornaments, their weapons and scabbards were adorned with gold and gems, and their nobles wore intricate personal jewellery."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_culture_uphold_the_old_ways"	"Ammianus Marcellinus, a Roman soldier and historian from the 4th century AD, gave a summary of the religious habits of the Alani people. He described their land as completely bereft of shrines or temples – there was not even a straw-thatched hovel to be seen. Their only idea of religion was to plunge a naked sword into the ground whenever they needed divine intervention. The weapon was then worshipped as a deity, most likely one of war and strife, such as Mars, according to the 'Interpretatio Romana'."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_economy_focus_on_husbandry"	"The nomadic people of the great steppes had been expert hunters since ancient times - an entire tribe would follow a herd of animals, hunting individuals in much the same way that natural predators did. Not every catch was killed and eaten, however, and it is possible that this is how such species as the horse, the goat, the yak, etc. were first domesticated. Once the herds were tamed, the nomads would still travel with them during their constant migration in search of rich pastures. The difference was that the relatively-domesticated cattle would now agree to be milked, sheared or slaughtered without much objection."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_economy_improve_sheep_selection"	"Breeding and raising livestock was a profitable activity for landowners, requiring far less labour and investment than arable farming. While animals were kept for meat, wool and dairy products for centuries, and animal husbandry was practised across the ancient world, it was the Romans who truly developed the art. Through selective breeding the Romans produced bigger, stronger livestock which provided more meat, milk, cheese and wool. They also developed fish farms, to satisfy the demand for fresh fish in inland provinces."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_economy_send_trade_envoys"	"The word 'tribe' implies unity and organisation and thus only loosely describes a nomadic people. They did not inhabit a single location, instead roaming around the great steppes. They accepted the strongest with the sharpest mind among them to be their chieftain and his will could bring them together, usually when a grand raid was planned. In other times, their activities were carried out either individually or in small groups, even things related to trade. When a chieftain desired a personal share of the trade profit, he would most likely outfit and send merchants selected from among his most trusted henchmen."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_governance_introduce_steppe_laws"	"The most distinctive quality of tribal life in nomadic culture was the lack of land ownership. The possessions of each family amounted to their horses, possibly a herd of cattle, some yurts and whatever they carried on their persons, such as clothes and weapons. Laws in steppe tribes therefore did not deal with hereditary ownership of land - the greatest item that a descendant could inherit was their father's livestock. Marriage was considered sacred and based on religious beliefs, but nomad women were rather warlike, so any indiscretions by the husband were likely settled between the couple. The nomads most likely also inherited the political value of marriage, as nomadic kings of old were known to marry foreign princesses for diplomatic reasons."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_governance_proclaim_legendary_kingdom"	"A common tale in barbarian beliefs was the existence of the 'king in the mountain', a legendary hero with the power to unite the tribes and bring immeasurable glory to his people. These stories were dedicated to great leaders as a method of immortalising them along with their heroic deeds. Sagas of 'worthy men' were told across tribal lands by both bards and family patriarchs. Barbarian armies were the most powerful and fearsome when they were led by such a ruler. They could achieve great victories over Rome or strike profitable alliances, such as the pact between Emperor Gallienus and the Marcomanni king, Attalus, in AD 258."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_civil_top_gather_herdsmen"	"Everything in nomad society had to move with the seasons. This is because the tribes depended on their herds for nearly every basic staple: meat and milk for sustenance, and wool for clothes. Sheep were bred for hardiness, as grazing on the steppes was seasonal and often sparse. Few other domesticated animals could survive reliably on the steppes; cattle certainly lacked the resilience to do so. The image of gentle herdsmen moving slowly across the steppes in search of rich grasslands is, however, less than the whole picture. Sheep may formed the basis of the Scythian economy, but this was a warrior society that preyed on its own kind, and on the settled farmers along the borders of the steppes."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_military_battle_adopt_hellenic_naval_traditions"	"Nomadic horsemen were a force to be reckoned in most spheres of warfare. However, they had no naval capabilities. Luckily, the Alani never really needed to board these "floating wooden houses" – the steppe was their sea and the steed their boat. Hypothetically, a fleet would have allowed the nomads to send surprise raiding parties along the coasts of the Black Sea, for example. In such cases, they would have most likely relied on imprisoned or enslaved naval craftsmen, well-versed in the intricacies of Hellenic shipbuilding principles. Such valuable people could construct ships or make vessels moored at a captured coastal settlement seaworthy."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_military_battle_announce_head_hunt"	"As is so often the case, a people’s enemies have a tendency to call them savage and dangerous in warfare; there is, after all, little glory in beating weaklings and cowards. The Scythians, however, do seem to have been particularly savage and merciless to their foes, and fully deserving of the reputation they were given by their civilised victims. Their practice of taking heads and, according to some sources, scalps, was not all that unusual; Gallic tribes took the heads of their enemies as trophies. It was the Scythian method of dividing the spoils after a battle that set them apart: men would be rewarded according the number of, and (presumably) the previously-living status of, heads that they took in battle. The heads themselves therefore attained the status of a currency used to purchase a share of captured enemy baggage."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_military_battle_issue_cavalry_chain_mail"	"Although the Romans often described barbarian warriors as bare-chested savages, there are classical accounts that clearly discuss their use of chainmail. Appian and Livy both describe “mail-clad” Celts fighting at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. Archaeologists have also discovered a number of Celtic grave sites containing mail-clad warriors, some of which date back as far as the 3rd century BC - making them some of the earliest examples of chainmail in the world."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_military_battle_practice_feigned_retreat"	"The steppe people fought as they lived - on horseback. Along with flanking charges and harassing manoeuvres, the feigned retreat was their favourite tactic. During a battle, the nomad army simulated exhaustion or mass panic, which escalated into a fake retreat. The idea behind this was to trick the enemy into pursuing. Once they were in full pursuit and lost coherence, the nomads would counter-attack, crushing the entire enemy army or at least a portion of it. In the latter case, depending on the level of disarray among the enemy lines, it was possible to repeat the feigned retreat again and again until victory was achieved."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_military_battle_train_with_composite_bows"	"A composite bow is made of many layers, cleverly arranged to take advantage of the properties of each: the outside of the bow is often sinew, which stretches, attached to a wooden core, with horn, which can be compressed, on the inside facing the bowman. Such a weapon can store more energy when pulled than a simple wooden bow of similar size. This makes the composite bow an excellent weapon for mounted archers, as a large bow would constantly get tangled up in reins, or could not be quickly swung across the horse’s neck. However, archery is not a skill that is quickly mastered; archery from the back of a galloping horse is a skill doubly difficult to master, and until a mounted bowman can not only control his mount, usually with his knees, and string, aim and release an arrow at full gallop to hit the target, he is not a true steppe nomad warrior."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_military_campaign_unite_the_steppes"	"The steppes north of the Black Sea had been under the control of Scythian and Sarmatian tribes for centuries. By the 2nd century AD, the Alani held the lands near the lower Volga and Kuban rivers. Their dominance stood unsullied until Gothic tribes expanded southeast and drove the Alani away from the Black Sea. The reason might have been that, although the Alani were known to be skilled horsemen and great warriors, they were much less savage than the Germanic tribesmen they faced. The Alani were forced to retreat to the Don river, where they regrouped and prepared to ride back to the Pontic steppes. By uniting the tribes and with the aid of powerful allies, an Alani leader could rise and return his people to greatness, rivalling that of ancient Scythian kings."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_alani_military_top_breed_steppe_steeds"	"Historia Augusta, the collection of Imperial biographies, mentions that the army of Emperor Probus managed to capture a horse from the Alani. The beast, while not in possession of any striking visual qualities, could (allegedly) run a hundred miles in a day for eight or ten days in a row. Although this anecdote borders on fiction, the steeds of the nomadic peoples were known to have incredible endurance, their stamina being paired with the handy ability to survive in sparse pastures. It comes as no surprise that nomads were capable of traversing great distances to conduct a daring raid or to escape any force raised to resist them."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_culture_accept_christian_refuges"	"Christianity was already widespread by the end of the 3rd century AD – sizeable communities had grown in many large cities around the known world. As you might expect, persecution of Christians occurred relatively often, and was in most cases caused by their adamant refusal to worship pagan deities. Although there were some who accepted martyrdom, many preferred to flee oppression and keep spreading the faith in a friendlier place. One such place was Armenia, where many persecuted Christians sought refuge. At first, the Armenian king, Tiridates III (287-330 AD), opposed the incoming faithful, yet later he adopted Christianity as the official state religion."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_culture_adhere_tenets_zoroaster"	"According to tradition, the prophet Zoroaster received twenty-one books, created by the deity Ahura Mazda himself. The books formed the Zoroastrian holy scripture, the Avesta. As the Achaemenid dynasty of ancient Persia adopted Zoroastrianism, the Avesta came to be housed in a library at Persepolis, written with golden ink on parchments and leather sheets. However, Alexander the Great put Persepolis to the torch in 330 BC and the sacred texts were lost. Centuries later, the Sassanids restored the Avesta by piecing together fragments of the original text and filling in the blanks with oral traditions. Such a magnificent feat probably took years to accomplish yet it became a spiritual monument to the Sassanids’ devotion to Zoroastrianism."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_culture_develop_natural_sciences"	"The ancient scholars questioned the world around them and gradually began forming disciplines such as astronomy, geography, mathematics, medicine and philosophy to define their discoveries. Some of these early scholars went on to become the greatest thinkers of their day, forming schools to pass on their knowledge to others. The Egyptian city of Alexandria was the academic centre of the ancient world, home to a vast library of documentation and scrolls. It was a place of intellectual pilgrimage for all enquiring minds."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_culture_hire_royal_medicinemen"	"Persians realised very well the vital importance of medicine on both personal and social levels. Avesta, the holy scripture of Zoroastrianism, advised on various practices that promoted a healthy lifestyle. Any practical medical knowledge was most likely built on top of the Avesta and the experience of Greek physicians from Hippocrates to Galen. Sassanid rulers in particular contributed to the development of medicine in various ways. For example, Shapur I, the second Shahanshah of the dynasty, built the city of Gundeshapur, which grew into an essential centre for medicine and science over the next few centuries."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_culture_honor_sassanian_influence"	"The close proximity between Armenia and Persia helped establish a deep and complex connection between the two states. Their shared history was not without conflicts, as the Persians considered Armenia an inseparable part of their territory and responded with hostility to any Armenian attempts to proclaim independence. Aside from warfare, constant cultural and economic exchange also took place. After the Sassanid Shahanshah Shapur I conquered Armenia in AD 252, many 'nakharars' – or noblemen – realised that there is much to be gained by cooperating with the conquerors."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_culture_promote_religious_tolerance"	"As a meeting ground of numerous beliefs, faiths and philosophies, eastern lands were often, but not always, tolerant of diversity. With many of the ruling elite Hellenistic in origin, it was common practice to mix both Greek and local customs in religious observances. Rather than enforcing their own view, rulers commonly allowed their people and any immigrant settlers to continue their own religious practices. Other empires, such as Parthia, were diverse collections of many kingdoms, each with their own beliefs, encompassing everything from Zoroastrianism to imperial cults of personality. As long as religion didn't cause disloyalty or late payment of taxes, all was well!"	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_culture_recall_ancient_rites"	"Before its Christian period (that continues into the present day), the ancient Armenians had a rich religious history. Influences of various cultures came together to create a singular mixture of beliefs and folklore. The earliest known pantheon of the Armenians was composed of gods who were Semitic and Urartian in origin. The first Zoroastrian ideas entered Armenia during the reign of the Achaemenids over Persia. From this point on, until the beginning of the 4th century AD, it was the dominant religion in the kingdom, although local traditions added a unique hue to many of its concepts."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_culture_support_christianity"	"Shortly before Sassanids took over Armenia in AD 252, they employed a nobleman named Anak to assassinate the Armenian king, Hosrov II. In the ensuing chaos, Anak’s son, Gregory, was spirited away to escape death and entrusted to a Christian priest named Phirmilianos in Cappadocia. Under his guidance, Gregory embraced Christianity. After reaching manhood, he returned to Armenia to bring the Christian faith to his people and in this way atone for the misdeeds of his father. According to tradition, the Armenian king at the time, Tiridates III, held Gregory in prison for over twelve years until God punished him with terrible madness. In an act of mercy, with the power of true faith and prayer, Gregory cured the king. As a result, Tiridates changed his attitude, and a few short years Armenia became the first officially Christian state in the world."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_culture_welcome_latin_influence"	"As Romans steadily expanded into the east they realised Armenia's immense strategic importance – friendship and an alliance with the kingdom would grease the wheels of the Roman war machine on its way towards Persian lands. Armenians, on the other hand, often relied on Roman interests in order to promote their own agenda. They were not always successful, however, and Armenia passed from the Persian sphere of influence into Roman control, and vice versa, several times."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_economy_control_silk_roads"	"The trade between Persia and China was of paramount importance to the Sassanids, with the goods travelling along the Silk Road constituting a colossal amount to the Persian economy. Defence of the caravans was key, therefore, to ensure both that trade was successful and that his Chinese trading partners were aware of how much the Shahanshah valued them. As well as caravanserai – lodging-houses and inns where weary traders could rest – the Sassanids also set up fortresses and outposts along the road to deter bandits and robbers from attempting to loot the caravans. In this way the trade routes were maintained and guarded, and the goods could flow."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_economy_create_royal_bazaars"	"After a period of civil war, the Sassanid Dynasty overthrew Parthians and in 224 Ardashir was crowned as the first Sassanid ruler of Persia. He stabilized his power by quelling local rebellions and expanding his realm. As the dust settled it became apparent that the new empire needed the support of a bureaucratic system complex enough to cater to the needs of the Shahanshah and his subjects. Provincial governors, counsellors, judges, accountants, simple scribes – the administration required all these offices to be filled up by people who were as diligent as they were loyal. Zoroastrian priests seem to have played a special and prominent role in the administrative hierarchy as evidenced by discovered seals dating from Sassanid times."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_economy_extend_royal_benevolence"	"The Parthian model of governance was very laissez-faire, with numerous satrapies swearing loyalty to the Parthian monarch but acting almost entirely independently, only feeding back support and wealth to the Arsacid rulers. Whilst the satraps invariably rose as one to fight when called upon, the Parthian system allowed the high noble families to exercise vast control over the empire and the Arsacid kings. Ardashir I, the first Sassanid king, placed greater emphasis on the role of the state across the empire. He settled new cities in his name, and renamed old provinces, populating them with his own people. In this way, he created regional headquarters for central administration, pushing his ideology and doctrines across the empire in a more stratified manner."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_economy_hire_roman_translators"	"As trade networks between countries and regions grew, the language of trade evolved. Merchants were no longer dealing with men from the next town over: vast trade routes like the 'Silk Road' linked Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe. Language skills became almost as valuable as spices. In eastern kingdoms, Aramaic remained the recognised language of trade, but a knowledge of the basics of Greek and Latin became essential as many goods, particularly spices, became sought after commodities in the west."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_economy_implement_terraced_fields"	"With an ongoing struggle to collect and harness water supplies to irrigate their fields in arid climates, eastern civilisations turned to terracing in order to utilise land on hills and mountainsides. Narrow fields, formed as steps in the sloping land, allowed hillsides to be farmed with little risk of soil erosion. Each step, or field, was irrigated by a network of canals. In Mesopotamia, terraced fields were irrigated by a network of 'shadufs' which were placed on each step. This simple ancient water-lifting device was made up of a large beam, supporting a rope and bucket, with a counter weight at the opposite end."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_economy_order_land_reclamation"	"Agriculture in desert regions was chiefly hampered by the general lack of water due to low precipitation and lack of rivers or lakes. To overcome this problem, the inhabitants of arid areas developed the qanat system which involved sloping underground tunnels that transported water to arable land plots. In river regions dams could be constructed to ensure proper irrigation at all times. A famous one was built in the 3rd century, during the rule of Sasanian Emperor Shapur I by captured Roman soldiers. Known as Band e-Kaisar or Caesar’s dam, it made the nearby city of Shushtar into a prominent agricultural centre for centuries to come."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_economy_plan_grand_canals"	"Agriculture in the east was often blighted by erratic rainfall in a harsh landscape. Farmers soon realised that irrigation systems, like canals and dams, were ideal for storing and transporting the water they needed for 'dry-farming' in these areas. In Mesopotamia, the Euphrates and Tigris rivers were unpredictable and could often swell after sowing season, flooding the crops. Storage basins were therefore used to collect the surplus water, and a canal system was constructed to distribute it as needed to the fields."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_economy_plan_irrigation_infrastructure"	"Basic irrigation systems were widespread in the ancient world because they were simple to maintain. Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage, and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. In Mesopotamia, the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_economy_tax_the_nobility"	"The Sassanids inherited the Parthian satrapy system, whereby major noble families were empowered to guard the integrity of the state both in terms of the economy and the armed forces. The new ruling dynasty, however, desired to have as much direct power over matters as possible, which led to the establishment of royal cities, built at the order of the Sassanid ruler and bearing his name. After its founding, such a city served as a military base and eventually grew into a regional administrative centre. Royal cities were governed by a representative of the Shahanshah with the title of 'Shahrab'. According to historical sources, Ardashir I, the first Sassanid ruler, established no less than eight royal cities during his reign. The creation of a royal city was a costly endeavour, and it is possible that the Shahanshah imposed additional taxes on noblemen and governors to secure the required funds."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_governance_assume_the_crown_authority"	"The royal crown was as a symbol of the authority its owner held over his subjects. The Shahanshahs of the Sassanid dynasty wore crowns of great intricacy and variety. Instead of having a single crown that would be passed from predecessor to successor, every single ruler in the dynasty had a crown made specifically for him. The earliest members imitated the Parthian style of headgear, while in later centuries crowns had a more distinctive style that was less individualistic but more complex. It is even possible that apart from the personal preferences of the Shahanshah, the exact shape and details of the crown were governed by strict regulations."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_governance_complie_code_laws"	"The tenets of Sassanid legislation were rooted in Zoroastrianism, which taught that order and truth could only be achieved by observing the laws given by Ahura Mazda and overseen by Mithra. In practice, Zoroastrian priests held legal power and even the Shahanshah's will was declared secondary to divine decree. Non-Zoroastrian crown subjects were allowed to abide by the law of their own religion, with cases of capital crime being an exception to that rule. Additionally, different regions had local laws and legal practices named 'kardag'. Areas populated by migrating nomads may have adhered to the 'kardag' principle completely."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_governance_control_urban_development"	"The Sassanid Shahanshahs were known to be great builders and such fame was well deserved. Many of them not only established completely new cities but also improved existing ones. For example, the metropolis of Ctesiphon was greatly expanded during the Sassanid period as it served as a capital city where royal coronations took place. Its many suburbs gradually came to sprawl along both banks of the River Tigris and, in time, Ctesiphon came to resemble several cities close to one another rather than a unified whole. Among the more notable buildings were a magnificent palace (known as the 'White Palace'), a great fire temple and even a Christian church."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_governance_demand_zealous_labour"	"As populations boomed the demand for food increased, driving farmers to use more intensive farming techniques. Technology played its part, with improved tools and the domestication of large animals to pull advanced and effective ploughs. Larger labour forces and the growth of other techniques, such as terraced farming, opened new areas for cultivation. The construction of more complex canals and dams helped to turn arid landscapes into well-irrigated farming plots."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_governance_establish_vigorous_administration"	"After a period of civil war, the Sassanids overthrew the Parthians and in AD 224 Ardashir was crowned the first Sassanid ruler of Persia. In the following years, he proceeded to consolidate his power by quelling local rebellions and expanding his territory. As the dust settled, it was apparent that the new empire required a bureaucratic system of considerable complexity. Provincial governors, counsellors, judges, accountants, simple scribes – all these offices had to be held by people who were as diligent as they were loyal. Zoroastrian priests played a special and prominent role in the administrative hierarchy too, as evidenced by discovered seals dating from Sassanid times."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_governance_extend_peasant_class_rights"	"Composed of diverse cultures, eastern states contained many different forms of social hierarchy. Those following Alexander the Great's empire, such as the Seleucids, usually maintained the Hellenic traditions of their predecessors and a great deal of Greek culture besides. Over time, the native nobility adopted these ways as a means of advancement, creating a Hellenised elite. Underneath them were native people and an ever-increasing influx of colonists, all too busy trying to live to worry about much beyond their homes and food. In contrast, the great Parthian kings embraced their Persian heritage, reviving many of their traditions."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_governance_glorify_illoustrous_lineage"	"The ruler of Sassanid Persia bore the title of Shahanshah or 'King of Kings' for a reason. He held all the authority in his hands and every person in the realm must obey his will. However, it was not enough to simply hold authority – much like a garden, it had to be expanded and improved in every possible way. One such way was to claim that the Sassanids were descended from Achaemenid dynasty which had ruled Persia from the middle of the 6th century BC to 330 BC, when it was destroyed by Alexander the Great."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_governance_proclaim_grand_armenia"	"The Artaxiad dynasty ruled the kingdom of Armenia from 189 BC until AD 12. During its reign, Armenia reached an unprecedented level of power and influence. After Tigranes II assumed the throne in  95 BC, he cleverly took advantage of the political situation. It was a turbulent one – Rome warred against King Mithridates of Pontus while external invasions and civil strife gradually weakened the Parthians and Seleucids. In a series of campaigns, Tigranes extended Armenian territory from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caspian and bestowed upon himself the title 'King of Kings'. Although Roman Legions forced him to relinquish the fruits of his conquest and put an end to this glorious period of Armenian history, the memory of his achievements lived on."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_governance_promote_trusted_councillors"	"The power of the Shahanshah was almost absolute. However, his opponents (often members of his own family) often conspired to reduce his influence or even forcibly dethrone him. As the latter option involved death, it was extremely important for the Shahanshah to choose whom he could trust and who to shun. Once a close circle of 'friends' was established, they could be empowered to further the will of their lord. As you might expect, the Shahanshah sometimes tested that allegiance to ensure his friends were still loyal."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_civil_top_honor_sassanian_mandate"	"In the 3rd century AD, Armenia was ruled by the Arshakuni dynasty, a branch of the Parthian Arsacid dynasty. As Sassanids overthrew the Parthians in Persia and turned their eyes northwards to Armenia, the Armenian king at the time, Tiridates II, requested Roman help to counter the threat. Alas, the Sassanid Shahanshah Shapur I crushed the Romans and forced a peace treaty upon them. Then he installed his son, the future Sassanid Shahanshah, Hormizd, on the Armenian throne. Thus Sassanian influence extended over Armenia; it would remain that way until the next Roman intervention in the region's balance of power."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_battle_dominate_the_crossroads"	"Geographically, Armenia was situated on the border between the Roman Empire and Persia. Each of these two superpowers tried to dominate the other by means of diplomacy or military conflict. Armenia was caught in the middle and throughout its history it received Roman and Persian influences in regular doses, while sometimes being allied to Rome and sometimes to Persia. In time, the Armenian army adopted a multitude of western and eastern combat practices and could therefore fight back with efficiency against either of the two empires."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_battle_glorify_hayk_legacy"	"Archery was an important part of Armenian warfare and from the very conception of the Armenian state. According to legend, Armenia was founded by a hero named 'Hayk'. At some point, his rule was challenged by the hosts of Bel, an evil Assyrian king. An epic battle between the armies of the two rulers ensued. During the battle, Hayk shot a three-feathered arrow with such force that it pierced Bel's armour and slew him instantly. His death frightened the enemy army, which dispersed and enabled the Armenians to win the day. For centuries to come, generations of archers would honour the memory of Hayk's skill by honing their marksmanship to perfection."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_battle_issue_composite_bows"	"A composite bow is made of many layers, cleverly arranged to take advantage of the properties of each: the outside of the bow is often sinew, which stretches, attached to a wooden core, with horn, which can be compressed, on the inside facing the bowman. Such a weapon can store more energy when pulled than a simple wooden bow of similar size. This makes the composite bow an excellent weapon for mounted archers, as a large bow would constantly get tangled up in reins, or could not be quickly swung across the horse’s neck. However, archery is not a skill that is quickly mastered; archery from the back of a galloping horse is a skill doubly difficult to master, and until a mounted bowman can not only control his mount, usually with his knees, and string, aim and release an arrow at full gallop to hit the target, he is not a true steppe nomad warrior."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_battle_motivate_your_hirelings"	"Subsistence in small settlements became increasingly harder as the Roman Empire fell into crisis. Many villages were left defenceless and had to fend for themselves. Bandits, pirates and rogue military regiments were a common occurrence, some of them forming large companies and becoming strong enough to be recognised as a threat to smaller states. With the proper 'encouragement', they could be persuaded to fight as mercenaries, supporting the military effort of the highest bidder - the right amount of gold can make a band of raiders fight with impressive fervour."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_battle_praise_armenian_nobility"	"The nobility have always played an important role in Armenian society. Their roots trace back to ancient tribal group structures, where noble clans claimed ancestry either with the gods of old Armenian religion or the heroes and patriarchs of the Armenian people. The aristocratic class was so ingrained into the government of Armenian regions, that even under Sassanid rule the royal city system could not be imposed on them as it was on other satrapies. Officially, the lands belonged to the Sassanid Shahanshah, but every governor of Armenia appointed by him had to build a relationship with its noble houses, for they supplied the strongest warriors, had the richest coffers, and exerted control over the common people."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_battle_refine_your_naval_artillery"	"The Hellenistic world was at the forefront of construction when it came to huge war galleys bristling with artillery. Alexander the Great used catapults from his ships when he besieged Tyre in 332BC, and it was the Greeks who built the most formidable floating fortress of the time, the Syracusia. Designed by inventor Archimedes, this huge transport vessel was said to be 55 metres in length. It featured a raised fighting deck that housed a giant catapult capable of switching between firing a five metre dart or a 80 kilogramme stone missile."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_battle_research_your_machines_of_war"	"For centuries the Roman Empire was unrivalled in the art of siege warfare. Even larger states such as Parthian Persia were not up to par with the Imperial engineers. The Sassanid dynasty, however, brought about a reformed military that was sufficiently capable of conducting sieges. For example, the Siege of Amida in AD 359 shows the Persians assaulting Roman fortifications with iron-clad siege towers and under the artillery support of 'scorpions'. A century before that battle, at the dawn of their rule, the Sassanids conquered the town of Dura Europos by trying to undermine its walls - one of the earliest examples of sapping and tunnel warfare."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_battle_reward_your_kataphractoi"	"The term 'kataphractoi' is of Greek origin and can be interpreted as 'fully-armoured' or 'closed from all sides'. In military terms, it described heavily-armoured cavalrymen. These shock troops were first fielded as part of Darius’ army at Gaugamela in 352 BC. Mostly Bactrian and Scythian horsemen, these riders and their mounts required excellent stamina as they were completely enclosed by metal scale armour, and in desert heat too! Cataphract cavalry could use their weight and armour to penetrate an enemy line, but were far less agile than regular horsemen."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_battle_teach_sailors_fight"	"By the 5th century BC naval battles were changing, as the ship’s ram became the principle weapon, making artful seamanship and carefully timed manoeuvres the key to success. There were a range of recognised tactics, including the 'periplous' - an outflanking manoeuvre - and the 'diekplous' - a more complex movement which was also known as "breaking the line". Here an attacking ship would navigate between two enemy vessels and rely on superior speed and agility to ram the midships or stern of its target. This tactic could be aided by sailing close enough to the enemy to shear off their oars, immobilising them before ramming."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_call_noblemen_to_arms"	"Armenian society had a complex system of nobles that were organised into a strict hierarchical order. In war, they were obliged to support the king by providing troops for the army. The majority of these troops were cavalrymen and the quality of their armament and training was a measure of their master's power. The heavy cavalry of the Armenian kings was well known across the ancient world as a formidable fighting force. Historians claim that it was an early precursor to the armies of medieval times, which were dominated by mounted knights."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_elevate_noble_houses"	"'Nakharar' was a hereditary title of the highest order, given to the heads of Armenian noble houses. Similar to the government of the neighbouring Parthian Empire, Armenia was divided into large estates, each ruled by a Nakharar. The whole household was devoted to worship of the same ancestors, living in small, well-protected villages. Each Nakharar family had a particular social purpose assigned to it - one of them was associated with the king, another with the military commander, and so on. This system survived the fall of Parthia and the introduction of Sassanid governors, allowing a great deal of autonomy for Armenia as a satrapy."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_employ_mardomard_champions"	"In ancient times, a battle was often prefaced by a duel between champions from the opposing sides. In the Sassanid Empire, the challenge to single combat was known as 'mard o-mard' and members of the elite fighting units were trained in all intricacies of this personal battle style. A duel and its outcome had a special ceremonial meaning for the Persians. According to sources, the peace treaty between Sassanids and Romans from AD 421 was signed after a Persian champion perished in a mounted bout against a Gothic warrior in service of Rome."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_enforce_conscription"	"The real strength of the Sassanid army was, primarily, heavy cavalry and seasoned skirmish troops. The Savaran cavalry were led by the 'great' families of noble Persian and Parthian blood. This mounted corps was also often reinforced by mercenaries. Infantry, by contrast, were not usually held in much regard, with some even referring to the levied Paighan – from which the vast majority of Sassanid infantrymen were drawn – as 'a crowd of pitiable peasants'. These poor quality levies were raised by the aristocracy, conscripted from the lands they owned to act, in most cases, as little more than ‘meat shields’ for the Sassanid advance. This social aristocracy bled quite clearly into the military, and remained as the basis for all military recruitment and conscription until the reforms of Khosrow I, who altered the system so that lesser nobility, primarily farmers and land-owners, could be drawn into the army. This dramatically reduced the aristocracy's power, as the armour and weaponry was provided by the state, meaning the newer forces swore loyalty to the Shahanshah himself, and not his local feudal lords."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_enforce_voluntary_service"	"Among the elite soldiers in the Sassanid infantry were its archers, trained to deliver rapid volleys of arrows from behind large walls of wicker shields. Those shields were manned by the unimpressive Sassanian foot soldiers – a conscription force, recruited from the peasant population. They are described as pitiful troops of little fighting ability, despised by the veteran Persian warriors whom they served. Since these peasant troops were present in such high numbers, they often had to arm themselves with agricultural tools such as pitchforks, axes and sickles. These levies had the lowest morale in the Sassanid military and would often cluster together for protection during an engagement. They were not a threat to any regular army, but their purpose was to be an obstacle, a human shield before the cavalry and archer regiments."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_hasten_your_military_expanse"	"An army can live off the land in most places, although deserts are an obvious exception. What can’t be found, stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with it: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load, medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted. He will not give his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_hire_nisean_breeders"	"Nisean horses were famed for their speed and beauty, making them the most sought after and expensive steeds in the ancient world. The Persians held them as sacred and limited their use to the nobility; two grey Nisean stallions pulled the royal chariot. They became so sought after that the Greeks imported them to breed with their own native horses and when Alexander conquered Persia he demanded a tribute of Nisean horses from the cities he captured."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_improve_your_mercenary_administration"	"Mercenaries have existed for thousands of years but the earliest written record of them dates back to the 7th century BC, when Greek hoplites sought employment as bodyguards serving Pharaohs and Greek tyrants alike. Mercenaries became a great way to bolster troop numbers during times of war, something to which the Carthaginians resorted during their war with Rome. They exploited their trade links to recruit troops from the Iberian peninsula and the Balearic islands. The Romans were more sparing with their use of mercenaries, but acknowledged the shortcomings within the Legion, notably archers and cavalry, by making up for the lack with carefully chosen mercenary troops."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_reorganize_zoranamak"	"To facilitate the defence of its kingdom, the Arshakuni royal dynasty divided Armenia into regions known as 'gates', of which there were four, one for each cardinal direction. The gates surrounded the central region of Ayrarat, the king's seat of power. Every noble family was assigned to a specific 'gate' and was obliged to raise a certain number of troops in case of external threat. Finally the families were listed in a special document, named the Zoranamak, or 'military registrar', which served as an invaluable reference to the king. Thanks to this system, the Armenian army could quickly muster a defensive force and repel any attacker."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_campaign_starve_your_enemies"	"As populations grew and the demand for food increased, long-term storage of grain became vital. With improved transport allowing for the movement of grain, it became possible to construct vast storage warehouses to hold shipped-in food stock. The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population, but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or 'horrea' were built along the embankment of the River Tiber, in an area known as the Emporium district."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_recruitment_emphasize_on_your_cavalry"	"Cavalry was the major strength of the Sassanid army. To achieve victory in his wars, the Shahanshah relied on heavily armoured cataphracts and clibanarii to charge at the enemies and disperse them. Sometimes enemies were brave enough to retain their formation in the face of the oncoming hooved-tide of death and, in such cases, swift horse archers unleashed volleys of arrows to soften up stubborn foes. These mounted bowmen usually wielded composite bows that gave them the ability to shoot in any direction while on horseback. An arrow fired from such a bow flew with such force that it could pierce straight through the shield of a Roman Legionary."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_recruitment_exact_your_levies"	"Sassanid soldiers were recruited from various sources. At the bottom were the units of light infantry, poorly equipped and lacking in training. Then there were the more quality troops provided by landowners, governors or allied nations. The majority of the horse archers comprised of petty nobles and sometimes nomad mercenaries. The ranks of elite heavy horsemen, however, were filled by members of important noble clans and families - those who could afford steeds and equipment and the time to train in their use."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_recruitment_expand_tactical_exercises"	"As armies adopted flexible forces, subdivided into units, each with their individual function and strengths, tactical drills became the difference between victory and defeat. Layered tactical manoeuvres could be planned and executed to counter any enemy and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC. Here the Romans effortlessly moved as one to create open lanes in their formation, allowing the rampaging beasts to charge harmlessly through their ranks."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_recruitment_improve_harbour_infrastructure"	"Aside from the wealth generated by the Silk Road, the Sassanids relied heavily on sea trade routes that brought commodities from India or Egypt. Their merchant fleets required ports of suitable size, where safe mooring was prepared for each vessel so that its goods could be easily unloaded and sent to stores or markets. It is quite probable that the Shahanshah personally oversaw the development of the larger ports and would make sure that a portion of the harbour space was dedicated to military ships – after all, trade routes always needed protection from pirate raids."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_recruitment_initiate_naval_dominance"	"All warships in the ancient world were limited in size by a number of practical considerations. This meant most were 'triremes' or 'threes', or perhaps 'quinqueremes' or 'fives', usually named for the number of banks of oars or the number of rowers. Being propelled by oars had limits: there were only so many rowers that could operate a single oar; there was a practical limit to the stroke and angle of an oar; and so forth. There was also a limit to how long and slender a galley could be before it would flex too much in any kind of sea and tear itself to pieces, but too broad a beam would make it a lumbering target. None of these constraints mattered to some nations, who built increasingly large vessels, culminating in a few '30s' and even a couple of '40s'. These gargantuan vessels must have been catamarans with fighting platforms linking the hulls, but they were all little more than vanity projects for the kings and Pharaohs who ordered their construction."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_recruitment_intensify_physical_conditioning"	"In Sparta, baby boys were examined by its elders at birth. Those considered too weak were cast from Mount Taygetos, but the worthy faced a childhood designed to condition them for the physical demands of war. The 'agoge' training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and universally feared fighting force. If a boy survived to the age of thirteen he was subjected to a further seven years of formal military training until finally, aged twenty, he would be considered to have reached manhood, ready to become a true warrior of Sparta. This 'Gold Standard' set by the Spartans reverberated down the centuries, as successive powers trained elite forces as shock troops that could turn the tide of battle when deployed at the right moment."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_recruitment_practice_strategic_maneouvres"	"While battles were traditionally fought on vast, open landscapes, there were exceptions and a clever strategist could use these to his advantage. Terrain was an effective form of defence, with high ground, woods and forests used to protect the rear and flanks of an army, particularly when faced with a cavalry-heavy opponent. Such features also offered cover for ambush attacks, and knowledge of their terrain became a key factor in the success of the Germans and Gauls who used guerrilla tactics to counter the organised ranks of the Roman army."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_recruitment_reorganize_military_hierarchy"	"Based on the Achaemenid military tradition, the Sassanid army had a sophisticated hierarchy. At the top of all armed forces was the 'Eran Spahbod' or 'Supreme Commander' – a nobleman that led and coordinated all military effort. The title of field general was 'Spahbod', whose duty it was to command an entire army or a portion one in cooperation with another Spahbod. The commanders of smaller troop divisions had different titles according to their troop types. For example, a 'Paygan-Salar' was a commander of infantry, a 'Pushtigban-Salar' a commander of the royal guard, etc. Fortress garrison commanders were given the title of 'Argbed', which might also have meant 'tax collector'. The early-Sassanid navy was nothing special, but still it had its 'Eran Spahbod' equivalent: the 'Navbed'. In almost all cases, members of the top military layers belonged to powerful noble houses, most likely extremely loyal to the Shahanshah."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_recruitment_summon_shipbuilders"	"Ship construction in the ancient world developed in response to the perceived need for bigger, stronger vessels. Double planking allowed the ancient shipwrights to build vast, strong hulls whilst keeping their ships light and manoeuvrable. The technique used two types of wood, with the inner layer constructed from a softer material than the exterior. In some cases, a layer of lead was placed between the wood in vulnerable areas of the ship, while cloth or wool soaked in wax was also placed between the layers to waterproof them."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_armenia_military_top_expand_supply_chain"	"The archer was a maligned figure within the ranks of the Greek and Roman armies, yet as ancient warfare evolved the need for them increased. The nomadic hordes of the east specialised in fast-moving bow cavalry and these skilled riders soon became coveted mercenaries. The need to keep these archers supplied with ample ammunition was a vital logistic requirement for the armies of the east. During the Battle of Carrhae, the Parthian general Surena used camels to supply arrows to his horse archers, allowing them to play a key role in Parthia’s victory."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_civil_culture_adopt_civilization"	"Although barbarian tribes had their own languages they often used the alphabets of other civilisations for their written records. For instance, early Celtic text, found on a variety of artifacts, used the Etruscan alphabet. However, around the 3rd century BC the use of Greek characters became more prevalent, especially in Gaul. Potters records, graffiti, and the Coligny Calendar have all been found in areas inhabited by Gaulish tribes, and were all written using the Greek alphabet."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_civil_culture_embrace_civilization"	"Romans initiated their conquest of the British isles in AD 43, during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Over the next few years, thousands of Roman dignitaries and officials settled with their families in the newly-formed province of Britannia. Numerous Celtic-built forts were garrisoned and a lot of Romans married local Britons, diluting and diversifying Britannia's culture and religion with the Roman way of life. Romanisation was in progress during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, culminating in the 'Constitutio Antoniniana', the edict of Emperor Caracalla, which granted citizenship to every free family. During the crisis that arose in the Roman Empire during the 3rd century AD, Britannia was largely independent - the southern half proclaimed allegiance to Gallic Rome and the northern Caledonii lands remained unconquered. The galvanising effect of Roman culture persisted, as some Caledonii chieftains wanted to advance tribal society into civilisation."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_civil_culture_promote_druidic_traditions"	"Druids were called upon to pass judgement on all disputes, even those between different tribes. They passed judgement on murders, disputes of inheritance or boundaries, and even decided the compensation to be paid and received. Should an individual refuse to accept druidic judgement they would be banned from taking part in sacrifices - the worst punishment that could be inflicted. They were then treated as outcasts, denied any future justice and excluded from a share of any honour won in battle."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_civil_culture_ressurect_druidic_order"	"Druids acted as knowledge-keepers in many barbarian societies. Afraid that their secrets may fall into the wrong hands, they never wrote anything down and so all information was passed verbally. Stories were passed down from generation to generation through the medium of poetry, song and dance. Classical sources, including Strabo and Caesar, suggested that it could take up to twenty years for a druid to learn everything he was expected to know. The education was not limited to folktales and rituals, as druids were also expected to memorise long and complex law codes in order to pass judgement in legal cases."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_civil_culture_seek_ancient_knowledge"	"Druids were thought to have knowledge of the 'Otherworld', as they read signs sent by the gods and interpreted their meaning for the tribe. This included reading the plant life that grew on the sacred oak tree and interpreting the movements of the stars and planets. As druidic doctrine was passed along verbally we may never have known the extent of their knowledge and understanding of astronomy if it had not been for Caesar, who in his chronicles wrote that “They also hold long discussions about the heavenly bodies and their movements, the size of the universe and of the earth, the physical constitutions of the world and the powers and properties of the gods”."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_civil_culture_seek_out_sacred_places"	"The oak tree was revered by the druids, who believed that the plants which grew on its trunk were signs from the gods. Mistletoe was the most sacred of all and gathering it was an important druidic ritual. The chief druid used a golden hook to remove the sprigs of mistletoe from the oak and then carefully tied them up in a piece of white cloth, as they were never allowed to touch the ground. The mistletoe was believed to be a universal antidote capable of countering any poison and a powerful cure for impotency."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_civil_economy_concentrate_on_agriculture"	"The Celtic plough was an incredibly advanced piece of farm machinery. The earliest records of its use were found on the Camonica rock carvings, in Val Camonica, north of Milan. While many societies continued to use ploughs with wooden blades or 'shares', the Celts began to make them from iron. They also introduced the coulter, a sharp knife that made a vertical cut and turned the soil over on itself. This innovation saved farmers a huge amount of time and effort, as a field could now be ploughed in one pass instead of two or more."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_civil_economy_finance_merchantmen"	"After the Romans unsuccessfully tried to subdue the Caledonii, contact between the two cultures were mainly limited to trade. According to a theory, in fact, the purpose of Hadrian's Wall was not so much defensive as a way to control trade routes. Even a sort of toll tax was required if a merchant intended to pass through. In the same sense, larger trading expeditions needed to be properly prepared for the additional expenditure that awaited them at Roman customs control. Apart from this, a wealthy merchant could reach further, travel safer and return with greater profit."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_civil_top_instil_dilligence"	"Contractual relationships in Celtic society were vital to their subsistence economy. A particular example of a Celtic contract was cooperative farming, by which farmers agreed when each of them had too few oxen to plough his lands on his own. For instance, Gaius Plinius Secundus, better known as Pliny the Elder, wrote that teams of up to 8 oxen were used to till the heavy soil of Gallia Cisalpina. As contractual obligations were of high significance in their culture, in situations when cooperating farmers were not kinsmen, they agreed to a formal contract. The combination of people working together and the well-developed agricultural practices meant that Celtic farms were a very efficient source of economy, a fact recognised by Roman invaders."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_military_battle_craft_tribal_totems"	"Animal totems played an important role in barbarian myths and legends. Many, like the pig or the serpent, were considered links between our world and the Otherworld. Some were seen as omens; a white stag for example was a sign of the ‘Wild Hunt’ – a group of ghostly hunters who rode through the sky looking for the spirits of the recently deceased. Others, like the bear, the boar and the bull were worshipped for their strength and power, and featured heavily in weapon and shield designs."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_military_battle_gather_votive_offerings"	"The practice of making votive offerings was widespread among the Celts. Instruments of war, such as shields, helmets and weapons, were regarded as prestigious goods and religious Celts likely sought to gain favour with their deities by offering especially-valuable weaponry. The offering itself involved burying the object in the ground or throwing it in a river or a bog. It was also believed that the head of a fallen enemy granted the warrior who bore it the power of its late owner. The heads were washed and embalmed, and the strongest fighting men kept them on walls or pillars as a sign of their personal strength. Using a head of a fallen foe as a votive offering was a way to show respect for the bravery he had shown in combat."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_military_battle_improve_chariots"	"The Britons' knowledge of working iron helped them to craft the war chariots that so impressed the Roman invaders. The wheels were wrapped in iron tyres that were purposefully made slightly too small. Wheelwrights would then heat the iron, making it expand. When it was placed around the rim, and allowed to cool, it shrank and bound the wheel’s components together. This was then further fixed to the wheel with large-headed nails that gave extra grip to the iron tyre."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_military_battle_issue_royal_war_horns"	"The use of instruments to direct battles was long part of the Celtic military tradition. In mid to late antiquity, the Celts used the 'carnyx', which was a bronze, wide-mouthed trumpet fashioned in the style of an animal's head crying out. The trumpet was used to rally allies and intimidate enemies in equal measure. There were many variations of this instrument used across the ancient world: the Ebdanians of Hibernia used hollowed-out bull horns, and the Picti and Caledonii used early versions of what would later be called bagpipes. The inhuman sound of these horns and pipes had an unsettling effect on the Romans, who could hear the dreaded Celtic army coming, but not yet see them."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_military_campaign_become_one_with_land"	"The last Roman attempt to conquer the Caledonii in northern Britannia was made by Emperor Septimius Severus. In AD 208 he assembled his armies and crossed Hadrian's Wall. After reaching the already abandoned Antonine Wall, he repaired and re-occupied its forts. Campaigning further to the north, however, proved to be a veritable nightmare; Roman troops had to traverse difficult terrain riddled with marshlands, rivers and thick forests; Caledonii warriors harassed the army with a variety of guerrilla tactics, and due to the numerous casualties, Roman morale began to plummet. Finally, although Severus reached the northernmost part of Britannia, he failed to subdue the locals and retreated to friendly territories to the south. The Caledonii remained independent from the south, and would continue to be for centuries to come."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_military_recruitment_assign_retainers_to_elite"	"Many tribes sought shelter from conflict in Roman territory, where in return for sanctuary they were forced to provide men of fighting age to bolster the army. However, it is not clear whether there were set agreements for all tribes or if they differed depending on the circumstances under which tribes arrived in Roman territory. Some may have been expected to make a one-off contribution when they first settled, whereas others had to present a certain number of men every year. Some, like the Tervingi, saw the benefits of this system and even implemented it among their own people, making military service compulsory."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_caledoni_military_top_fight_for_freedom"	"Julius Caesar was the Roman commander who initiated the conquest of Britannia in 55 BC. However, it took about a century and a half for Roman rule to become firmly established. Their control never really extended over the northern parts of the isle and its Caledonii inhabitants remained outside Imperial borders. Emperor Hadrian even built a wall from the eastern shore of Great Britain to the western to seal off Caledonii lands and control the flow of trade between the north and south. Hadrian's successor, Antoninus, built another wall further to the north, which was later abandoned. The exact reasons behind the Roman departure from the frontier of Antonine Wall are unclear. We only know that the Caledonii remained free and their warriors might have been the reason behind the Imperial retreat to the south."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gallicemp_civil_culture_celebrate_roman_heritage"	"At its height, the Roman Empire was the most extensive political and social structure, had the strongest military, and the largest trade networks. Rome's greatness is measured in its accolades, such as the ascent of Octavian to the position of Emperor, the ruthless conquest of Trajan in his expansion of Roman territories, and the construction of tremendous structures, either cultural – like the Colosseum – or military, such as Hadrian's Wall. Roman lineage carried intangible power and the mere mention of great historical names made any true citizen proud."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gallicemp_civil_culture_conduct_latinization_campaign"	"After conquering new territories, the Romans often invested considerable resources aimed at integration and ultimately assimilation of the native populace into Roman society. Many Imperial settlements had the status of 'colonia', inhabited by local tribesmen but governed by veteran soldiers. The process of 'Latinisation' was structured to fit into the hierarchy of tribal life - the native elites were introduced to a higher social standing by cultural means, such as dress, language and Roman laws. Each of the many colonia towns could be promoted into 'Civium Romanorum', which gave full citizen rights to all residents and enabled the construction of a temple to the official Roman cult."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gallicemp_civil_culture_facilitate_urbanization"	"The failing Roman economy during the chaotic Crisis of the 3rd Century caused the breakdown trade networks, which in turn left many settlements to fend for themselves. Furthermore, widespread civil unrest made it unsafe to travel, so large landowners focused on production for local trade and general subsistence. Special measures were then taken to ensure the safety of the workforce from raids by marauding bandits. These measures often amounted to gathering the population of isolated settlements and transferring them to developed cities, where stone walls gave sufficient protection from attack."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gallicemp_civil_culture_hire_winemakers"	"Wine was an integral part of Roman culture and its production was eagerly advanced and perfected by the Romans. It is worth noting that almost every modern winemaking region of Europe can trace its fame back to the time of the Roman Empire. The 'crimson spirit' was virtually everywhere, easily obtainable by members of all social strata – from lowly slaves to pompous Senators. Non-Romans were fond of the drink too; barbarians, for example, were known to raid civilised cities specifically for their wine stores."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gallicemp_civil_culture_pacify_the_chieftains"	"The Germanic tribes north and east of the Rhine welcomed the secession of the western Roman province with glee. The great crisis in the once mighty Roman Empire made raiding easy and the looting of helpless civilised settlements effortless. Barbarian raiding parties were not particular about which Roman lands they pillaged and they certainly didn't make an exception for the newly formed Gallic Roman Empire. In order to shape the Gallic provinces into a strong Roman state, the neighbouring  Germanic chieftains needed to be dealt with, preferably via diplomacy and bribery."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gallicemp_civil_economy_invest_in_agriculture"	"The principle of seed selection was simple: sowing the best quality seeds provided the best quality crop. The strength of a crop was affected by the seed from which it was grown and through seed selection a farmer could develop a crop free of disease that offered a more profitable yield. The farmer had to take the time to select only seeds from the most healthy and strong plants in a crop, removing the small, withered, discoloured or inferior seeds. Selecting the seed was usually simple: the best seed was the heaviest, and would therefore be found settled on the very bottom of the grain on the threshing floor."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gallicemp_civil_governance_reinstitute_the_republic"	"The Roman Republic was a beacon of civilisation in an otherwise wild and barbaric world. Its constitution divided the people into three main branches – the Assemblies, the Senate and the Magistrates. Power was distributed between the legs of this tripod, thus keeping every ruling party in check and preventing the rise of centralisation and dictatorship. However, the principles of the Republic crumbled as provincial governors seized more and more power for themselves, culminating in the assassination of Julius Caesar and the subsequent transformation of Rome into an autocratic empire. As the Empire fractured during the 3rd century AD, some people believed that the stability and social justice of the Republic could serve as a foundation for a new Roman state, one that would endure for centuries."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gallicemp_civil_top_gain_political_support"	"After the death of Postumus in AD 268, two Gallic Roman Emperors followed in quick succession. The first one, Marius, ruled for just a few months. His heir, Victorinus, managed to hold the throne for about two years. Then Tetricus ascended to the throne. Being well-versed in the complexity of politics, he was aware of the difficult situation he found himself in. First, he had to retain the favour of his troops, in order to avoid the sad fate of his predecessors, who were killed by their own soldiers. Then he had to secure lands against the constant threat of Germans and indeed other Romans. Additionally, challengers to Imperial authority could arise at any time. The overall situation was grim and only Tetricus' genuine administrative talent ensured Gallic Rome's survival."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gallicemp_military_top_conscript_germanic_soldiers"	"The Batavians were a Germanic tribe who dwelled on an island in the Rhine delta. Impressed by their military skill, the Romans did not demand that they pay monetary tribute, but instead provide soldiers for the army. Along with their ability to keep formation – unlike many other barbarians – they were known for the ability to swim while wearing full armour. Batavians were enlisted in the personal guard of several of the first Roman Emperors, and saw action all over the Empire. During the tumultuous 'Year of the Four Emperors', the Romanised Batavian leader, Civilis, incited his people to revolt and managed to exterminate two entire Legions before succumbing to Rome's superior military prowess."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_culture_expand_elder_futhark"	"The 'futhark' was the oldest form of writing used by Germanic tribes. It consisted of runic inscriptions bearing a deep mystical quality and was found on jewellery, amulets, tools, weapons and runestones. Knowledge of the runes was limited to priests – they alone could interpret the signs, either a blessing or a curse. The name of each rune was had symbolic meaning in its own right. Runes were often used in rites of divination and for interpreting omens. The tribesmen would cut off branches from nut-bearing trees and slice them into strips, then inscribe runes onto each strip and throw them onto a white cloth. Then the interpreter, a priest for official consultations or the family patriarch for private ones, turned his gaze to the sky while chanting prayers, and then picked up three strips without looking. The combination of runes either prophesised future events or gave answers to specific questions."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_culture_expand_the_cult_of_gaut"	"According to theories, the Gothi come from the far north of Europe. Their own sources claim an origin of divine nature from a single great ancestor named Gaut. After their great southern migration, the Gothi honoured Gaut as their chief divinity, who was sometimes compared to Roman Jupiter or Wodanaz, worshipped by other Germanic peoples. It is quite possible that Gaut was an in fact a historical person, perhaps a chieftain of fame and deeds so great that the memory of him remained with his people long after his death."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_culture_incite_the_tribes"	"In the 2nd century AD, migrating Germanic tribes such as the Marcomanni and Quadi advanced to the Roman frontier along the Danube river, causing the Marcomannic Wars. Not long after, barbarians started banding together, forming large confederations led by chieftains with similar powers to kings. Traditional tribal life was slowly abandoned in favour of centralised rule. The peoples still retained their unique clan identities, however, but ultimately listened to the most charismatic chieftains. On the surface, Rome saw this as a positive development, since the Romans would prefer to deal with a few authority figures who controlled the alarming amount of warriors living just across the Rhine and Danube. Unfortunately, the confederations amplified Germanic power and Roman soldiers were generally not too keen on friendly relations with the barbarians. The Roman Emperor Severus Alexander was killed by his own troops in AD 235 for negotiating peace through diplomacy and bribery with the Germanic tribes against his army's wishes."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_culture_organize_fairs"	"The Romans organised great festivals for various occasions both religious and mundane. A festival sometimes lasted for days and people were expected to have fun, avoid labour and make sacrifices if necessary. The tradition of great feasts was sometimes adopted by barbarian people and some celebrations were even held on the same day as their Roman equivalents. For example, the Germanic Yuletide holiday is said to have been related to the Roman Saturnalia – a festival that was likewise conducted in winter."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_culture_organize_feasts"	"The king's feast was a social event of great significance for barbarian people. It gave warriors an opportunity to confirm their loyalty to their leader. At the same time, during a feast the leader could reward his men as he saw fit and in this way be praised as generous ruler. It goes without saying that such celebrations involved an ample meal doused with copious amounts of alcohol – most likely plundered from civilised lands, as barbarians were not known for their brewing skills at this time."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_culture_revive_bardic_traditions"	"The barbarian peoples did not record their history, relying instead on individual memory and word of mouth to preserve significant events and famous deeds. Bards were poets and storytellers who sang songs recalling feats of bravery and heroism, as well as lineages and family histories of nobles and the ruling household. A bard could enchant his audience with his voice, raising their spirits and morale. Chieftains and nobles often employed these singers to provide entertainment during large feasts. Thus, they had a higher status in the tribe's warrior society. In order to preserve their tales, bards had apprentices to whom they passed on their poems and songs. The Romans despised barbarian bards, not just as savages, but as the main obstacle to Romanisation, since their songs prevented tribes from conforming to Roman ideals. Eventually, however, during the early 4th century AD, a massive surge in the adoption and popularity of Christianity led to the decline of the bard's relevance."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_culture_sanction_religious_processions"	"Although they shunned temples and monuments, believing that their gods did not reside within such earthly structures, many Germanic tribes used ritual chariots. The idea was that a chariot conveyed a deity’s spirit through the countryside, such as the one dedicated to the Nerthus, the goddess of fertility. Attended by her priests, the only people permitted to touch the chariot, wherever the goddess stopped great celebrations and feasts would be held. During these celebrations, none were permitted to take up arms, all weapons being put aside."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_culture_send_out_traveling_bards"	"Storytellers and singers were of great importance in ancient cultures, as they composed and performed musical pieces containing information regarding happenings of the day, usually embellished to emphasise the bravery of a certain warrior or the treachery of a foe, for example. Travelling around the land, these poetic newsmen were the living history of a people and were often used by chieftains and kings to promote their glorious rule in exchange for gifts or royal services."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_culture_uphold_the_old_ways"	"Religion among the Gothic tribes was purely tribal, in the sense that polytheism and ancestor worship were identical. The word 'god' itself is associated with the Gothic word 'guth' used to name pagan idols. Akin to Germanic paganism, from which Gothic religion developed, the Gothi consider deities to be too grand to be confined within temple walls and instead consecrated woods and groves. One peculiar difference between old Germanic and Gothic paganism is the absence of weapons in burials, which most likely meant that Gothic warriors passed their weapons down to their sons. The trinity of main gods in Germanic beliefs was kept as a pantheon, their places taken by the eponymous ancestor of Gothic people Gaut, the god of war Tiwaz and Fairguneis, who was similar to the Roman Jupiter. Along with these deities' priests, the Gothic 'reiks' or king was considered a guardian of ethnic traditions, who personally oversaw the ritual sacrificial feasts held by his subjects."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_economy_allocate_land"	"Many historians believe that the increase in production of consumables like pottery and jewellery in Celtic society was directly linked to an increase in contact with Rome. Trade with Rome had its benefits, and tribal leaders began to use their resources to make trade goods. Iron from Britain made it as far afield as Carthage in north Africa, proving that the ancient Celts knew more about trade than Roman writers, such as Caesar and Strabo, believed."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_economy_employ_gemcutters"	"Barbarian art was mainly focused on ornamentation of weapons and clothing for tribal warriors and their kin. Jewellery was directly linked to the status of a warrior within his warband and was even buried with him after his death. Some of the most refined forms of jewellery were carried by the Gothic tribes north of the Black Sea. Their metalwork was heavily influenced by Hellenistic and Scytho-Sarmatian goldsmithing, as well as jewellery plundered from Roman territory. The Goths favoured golden garnets of various shapes, connected by a chain and used to hold a mantle or a cape in place. The earliest Gothic pieces of jewellery were mostly bronze fibulae. Initially simple in nature, they grew more elaborate as time went on. Earrings were also common ornaments, to be worn by the wives of the Germanic nobility."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_economy_encourage_crafts_specialization"	"What evolved into a complicated society started out as a family group of hunter gatherers, where every person was expected to do more or less everything the other group members were capable of. The adoption of a sedentary lifestyle forced this growing group to split according to skill, where the weaponsmith and farmer were as important as the potter. This basic specialisation helped develop crafting traditions and educational methods, which in time improved the overall quality produced and, in time, the lives of the entire tribe."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_economy_focus_on_agriculture"	"Planting the same crop on the same plot of land each year will gradually strip the soil of its nutrients, weakening the plant and inviting pests. Ancient farmers found that by careful management these effects would subside, the soil would recover its fertility, and the crop would strengthen with each passing year. Various methodologies were practiced, including two, three and even four cycles of planting, with climate dictating the complexity of rotation and the crops that could be grown. One of the most popular techniques was the 'food, feed, fallow' system. This saw farmers divide fields into three sections and in each, start with a wheat crop, followed by a vegetable or cereal for livestock feed, and finally the land would for a time be left 'fallow', or unused, to replenish its nutrients."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_economy_improve_infrastructure"	"The Celts were prolific road builders, but sadly their trackways were constructed from wood, meaning few have survived the ravages of time. Luckily, some passed through bogs and have been well preserved, enabling us to learn more about them. The Corlea Bog in Ireland is home to one of the most complete Celtic timber trackways yet discovered; the tree-rings on the wood point to a felling date of 148BC, long before the Romans arrived and began building roads. There is also evidence to suggest that many Roman roads were built on top of the original timber trackways put there by the Celts."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_economy_introduce_king_currency"	"Examples of Celtic coins have been found in Britain dating back to the 2nd century BC. The Celts tended to mint their coins by casting gold, silver or bronze into moulds of burnt clay; each coin was then hammered between two stamps to give it its distinctive design. Just like any other rulers, Celtic leaders had coins minted with their names and faces on. Examples of these have been discovered, including coins minted for Cunobelinus, leader of the Britons, and the mighty Gaul Vercingetorix."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_economy_oversee_natural_economy"	"For many barbarians, the proper way to acquire riches was via conquest and plunder. Still, some of them attempted to trade, either within their own tribe or with neighbouring peoples. The Romans developed trading links with various tribes, thus spreading their 'civilised' ways. Among these was the notion that the chieftain (regardless of his actual title) needed to receive a share of trade that took place within his realm, either in the form of taxes or gifts by merchants who coveted royal friendship."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_economy_select_workers"	"The skill of ancient craftsmen is well known due to artefacts that have been discovered during archaeological excavations. Through their study and distinctive patterns, it has been possible to piece together a timeline of the emergence and expansion of the production methods used. By specialising in a particular skill or craft, a man's worth increased exponentially, and the items he produced became far more valuable than the cost of the materials used. This, in turn, guaranteed a livelihood for many."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_economy_set_up_markets"	"When barbarian tribes were not fighting each other, savvy tribesmen would barter commodities. Cattle and land were the most sought after, since they were both a basis for wealth and social status within a tribe. Barbarian leaders, for example, used their large rural farming areas and great herds to support the warbands they commanded. After the Roman Empire's conquests of some of the Germanic lands, trade between Rome and the native tribes flourished, as the Roman Legions relied on locals to supply them with slaves, leather and iron. As a result of conflict, a frontier zone (the 'Limes Germanicus') was drawn across the Rhine, separating Roman and German lands and establishing border trade. Roman trade wares included metalwork, glassware, wine and cloth – items that brought their new tribal owners much prestige."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_governance_appoint_lawgivers"	"Ancient barbarian society was built on agriculture, so naturally many of its laws dealt with this important aspect of life. Clearly identifying the boundaries between farmland was paramount, so boundary pillar stones were erected to demarcate the edges of people's property. The idea was that their presence would cut down the amount of land disputes that occurred, as moving the pillars to a more favourable position was very much a Herculean task. In Ireland, Cormac mac Cuileannanin’s ‘Sanas Chormaic’ called them ‘gallan’, as they were first erected by the Gauls when they arrived there. This type of stone has also been found in England and Scotland, often with names engraved on them in ‘ogham' script."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_governance_command_hygiene"	"One of the main reasons Roman citizens despised and loathed barbarians was their smell. Roman bathrooms and toilets were well developed, turning the act of bathing into a ritual form of communal activity. However, barbarian tribes may have been more hygienic than is commonly perceived. The Germans, for example, took a bath of warm water every day after waking from sleep. A tribe's cleanliness often depended on the presence of nearby rivers or springs, which were considered good locations to build homes. Some tribes, such as the Britons, developed a cult of water deities and mystical guardians of springs. The rituals associated with these spirits involved washing sacred objects, such as the chariot of the Germanic goddess of fertility, Nerthus. This would suggest that the barbarians of higher status also washed themselves, sometimes with the use of slaves, in lakes and rivers, in order to bring themselves closer to the divine. Of course, a commander who promoted hygienic practices would also have more warriors at his disposal, as generally less people would die from disease and infected wounds."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_governance_demand_oaths_of_fealty"	"Blood oaths to demonstrate loyalty one to another are a common feature in many cultures. By sharing blood two warriors become symbolic brothers, and are expected to treat each other as family members in all respects. Unlike modern interpretations of blood oaths, where both individuals make cuts and press them together so that their blood mingles, the Scythian oath involved shedding of a blood into a cup. The men then drank the mingled blood and demonstrated their mutual loyalty as brothers. No man was allowed more than three blood brothers, if only to avoid any potential tangles in conflicting obligations to different blood brothers. The custom of drinking the blood also neatly side-stepped any transfer of blood-borne diseases from one man to another by direct cut-to-cut transfer."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_governance_gain_recognition"	"Advising their elected kings, the elders of the Germanic tribes held great sway over the laws and elections among their people. Comprised of both an aristocratic elite and a priestly class, the latter being the moderators at election time, in theory councils prevented abuse of power by putting important matters to the vote. Standing before the seated council, the elected king or war-leader’s argument would be heard in silence. A decision would then be given, either being dismissed via murmuring or accepted by the brandishing of weapons."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_governance_gather_able_men"	"The legitimacy of the leaders of the Germanic tribes lay in their ability to bring warriors together and lead them to victory. At the same time, defeat on the battlefield at the hands of Roman Legionaries – or indeed other barbarian warriors – often signified a ruler's shameful end. Most military efforts were not meant to gain territory, but rather to obtain vital resources and, of course, glory. These allowed a war leader to grow by attracting warrior bands from neighbouring villages, either through ample booty or based on his fame alone. Large German armies were an exception, not the rule in ancient tribal warfare. Most consisted of roughly 100 men in a raiding party, with the sole purpose of plundering a nearby village. The Romans were able to use a 'divide and conquer' strategy when fighting the German tribes, defeating them in most engagements by undermining the very tribal connections on which they relied. On the few occasions when Germanic tribes fought in unison they had greater chances of success. A famous example was the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, where Arminius' victory was so total that Roman Legions never again attempted to fully conquer Magna Germania beyond the Rhine river."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_governance_improve_housing"	"The Aedui built an impressive settlement known as Bibracte near Burgundy in modern-day France. Its walls were thought to be five kilometres in circumference and five metres in height. Inside, the city was dominated by the royal palace and its streets were packed with craftsmen, jewellers, and ironworkers. Archaeologists have been able to study this site extensively owing to the fact that the initially pro-Roman Aedui avoided the treatment many tribes who fought against the Roman occupation of Gaul received, so their settlements largely remained intact as a result."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_governance_intimidate_the_opposition"	"Even if the barbarian chieftain showed bravery in battle and behaved honourably at all times, certain people would always question his authority. Still, they would obey him, as disloyalty meant banishment or even death. The chieftain had to tread carefully around such elements and weigh up the options at hand. In many cases, a show of force would suffice in disheartening potential mutineers. A riskier approach was to coerce the rebellious souls into openly challenging the chieftain and then defeat them in combat. The final option involved underhand methods, such as bribery or even assassination, yet either of these could bring dishonour and shame upon the chieftain himself if discovered."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_governance_proclaim_legendary_reikdom"	"The Gothi chose their 'reiks' (or king) based on nobility and military commanders based on valour. Neither of these two men ruled as a dictator however, as the kings did not have absolute, arbitrary power, and the commanders led by example, not by authority. Rome was content to support oligarchies that occasionally appeared among the Germanic peoples in order to prevent the establishment of strong states, but ancient kingship endured nonetheless. The king of noble birth was considered to be descended from divine royal ancestors, which were honoured for generations. On the other hand, a commander of warriors had to fight to achieve their status. A heroic triumph served as proof that a warrior was suitable to lead other men into battle. Under some circumstances, such a leader could found a new royal family, even if they had not been part of the nobility beforehand. A reiks with both the aspect of a nobleman and a war leader often attained legendary status among the local tribes - as great as the mighty Arminius or even the heroic Geat king of legend, Beowulf."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_governance_promise_glory"	"A barbarian's lifestyle comprised two distinct phases. The first was going to war, where great dangers lurked but fame awaited, with loot to match. The second consisted of days of peace which could be spent drinking, hunting, or indulging in some good old, blissful sloth. For a transition from the latter phase to the former to take place it was the chief's duty to properly motivate his drunken warriors and have them sober up, gather their arms and follow him when the time to fight arose. This he could do by retelling tales of past great deeds, reminding specific people of their fighting prowess, and exaggerating the wealth of the proposed enemy, while simultaneously belittling the strength of their armies."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_civil_top_organize_the_tribe"	"During the 3rd century AD, the Gothi often ravaged the Roman province of Dacia, sometimes even crossing the Danube to lay waste to Moesia. Particularly large raids often involved the majority of the tribal population. The Gothic reiks, Cannabaudes, was well aware of the significant challenge posed by such a massive military undertaking. Weapons had to be forged on the march, armour had to be repaired after each battle, and wagons constantly required mending. Every tribe member was required to have some skill in crafting in order to ensure the longevity of a raiding campaign or the quick flourishing of a new settlement."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_battle_favor_the_greuthungi"	"The Greuthungi were a Gothic people from the Pontic steppes thought to be the predecessors of the Ostrogoths. Once the Gothic tribes reached the Black Sea during their Migration Period, the Greuthungi were more receptive to the local Sarmatian people and adopted some of their ways. Probably this is why, in battle, the Greuthungi preferred fighting on horseback. They may have not been savage and ruthless in hand-to-hand combat, but showed remarkable skills with a lance, similar to the impressive, armoured horsemen of the Scythian tribes."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_battle_favor_the_tervingi"	"The Tervingi were a Gothic tribe who occupied the Danuban plains west of the Dniester river. Historians claim they were the ancestors of the Visigoths. The Tervingi were first mentioned in accounts that describe their invasion of the Roman Empire in AD 268. The Gothi overran Pannonia and Illyricum, even threatening to march on Rome herself. However, as commander of the Roman cavalry, Aurelian routed the Gothi at the Battle of Naissus, which in turn led to his ascent to become Emperor. Although routed, the Tervingi were not destroyed, however, and Aurelian later abandoned the fight against them, leaving the province of Dacia to the Gothic tribes. Tervingi swordsmen were skilled enough to reach the inner Roman province and this might have been the reason why Aurelian deemed a prolonged defence of Dacia to be a waste of resources."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_battle_gather_footmen"	"Although many barbarian tribes favoured ambush and shock tactics, there were some who developed techniques especially for use in pitched battles. The Germanic tribes, for instance, favoured columns, and when warriors from different tribes fought together each tribe formed its own column. This not only allowed tribes to fight in their own styles - using their own chants and war dances - but created rivalry on the battlefield, encouraging tribes to prove their fighting prowess to their neighbours."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_battle_gather_horsemen"	"For the eastern nomads, owning a horse was a necessity. In the Germanic tribes, however, only the wealthiest and most influential could afford one. In general, the European barbarians seem to have been more comfortable fighting on foot. When they did have horses, they often rode to battle, dismounted and marched into the fray in infantry fashion. Still, they were expected to show equal prowess and skill, both in and out of the saddle. Aside from harassing and chasing down routed foes, a cavalry charge always proved a viable tactic. When launched at the rear or the flank of an enemy force, it could work wonders. In fact, such a charge secured the Gothic victory against Rome at Adrianople."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_battle_gather_sailors"	"Barbarian ships were smaller and lighter than the equivalent civilised vessels. Unfortunately, this made fitting an artillery piece, such as a ballista or a catapult, onto a barbarian ship impossible. The fact that barbarians had said in the first place that artillery pieces did not help either. Ranged combat under these circumstances was limited to showers of arrows, stones and other hand-held projectiles. Individual ships in a fleet probably manoeuvred so that fire could be concentrated on a single enemy vessel, softening up the crew before a boarding attack."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_battle_issue_infantry_chainmail"	"Although the Romans often described barbarian warriors as bare-chested savages, there are classical accounts that clearly discuss their use of chainmail. Appian and Livy both describe “mail-clad” Celts fighting at the Battle of Magnesia in 190BC. Archaeologists have also discovered a number of Celtic grave sites containing mail-clad warriors, some of which date back as far as the 3rd century BC - making them some of the earliest examples of chainmail in the world."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_battle_issue_oaken_ship_hulls"	"Sacred to many barbarian tribes, the oak was believed to possess great spiritual strength and act as a gateway to the Otherworld. As a shipbuilding material it provided incredible hull strength, which was vital for ships sailing the rough Atlantic waves. Both Caesar and Strabo wrote of the strength of warships built by the Veneti tribe, stating that ramming attacks did very little damage to their strong oak hulls, forcing the Romans to develop new tactics to defeat them."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_battle_practice_boar_head_formation"	"The 'boar's head' was a tactical formation widely used by Germanic barbarians, both when fighting on foot or mounted on horses. It was either wedge-shaped or rectangular, with its flanks and rear well protected. The leader of the formation usually marched in the front row of the boar's head and the rest of the warriors followed his movements. The main advantage of this formation was its compactness, which in turn granted it a fair degree pf manoeuvrability on the battlefield. Charging an enemy line yielded one of two possible outcomes. First, the formation could punch through the enemy and disperse them. In case the enemy line held, however, the boar's head stopped and expanded as Germanic warriors from the rear rows moved around their frontline brethren to engage the enemy."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_battle_spread_stories_black_sea_raiders"	"The Gothi moved in territories neighbouring the Roman Empire around the Balkan Peninsula and began launching incursions across the Danube in AD 238. Along with land raids, they assembled a marauding fleet, most likely composed of river boats refitted to sail sea waters. The fleet was based somewhere in the Danube delta or the northern Black Sea coast and its ships were said to number at over 500 vessels when a sizeable operation was under way. During the middle of the 3rd century AD, this Gothic navy laid waste to Thrace, Moesia, and the Greek and Anatolian shoreline. They even reached further south to Crete and Rhodes, where Roman fleets managed to repel them. Defeats did little to break the barbaric lust for plunder, however. Time and again, they would gather a new fleet and sail south in search of riches. It took a true leader, such as Aurelian, to thwart their foul practices."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_campaign_copy_roman_smithing"	"When speaking of barbarians, early Roman sources generally describe them not only as being poorly disciplined but badly equipped as well. Armour was a rare sight and the spear was the main weapon, as it could be produced cheaply and its use could be easily taught to new recruits. As time went by, Roman civilisation seeped out of its borders and barbarians gradually developed more sophisticated of mass weapon manufacture. Although they could not hope to compete with Imperial fabricae in terms of quality and quantity, this allowed barbarians to procure reliable arms without having to capture them from the Romans."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_campaign_encourage_oneonone_training"	"The image of hundreds of bare-chested warriors descending on an enemy is one that Roman historians used time and time again. What they neglected to mention was the Celtic tradition of deciding battles through single combat. A brave champion would step from the ranks and present his challenge, boasting of his great deeds and those of his ancestors before him. Once two champions had done battle, the victor had won the war for his tribe and they would return home. However, the Romans did not hold to these traditions, and even if a Celtic champion beat a Roman in single combat, they would fall on the unsuspecting Celts to exact revenge for their fallen comrade."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_campaign_expand_warleader_retinue"	"The land inhabited by the barbarian tribes was divided into separate kingdoms of varying size, whose borders constantly shifted. Alliances emerged and were quickly broken again, as every raid launched against neighbours warranted a retaliatory strike. This constant strife was of generally low intensity, however, and thus it did not require the entire populace to mobilise and take part. Instead, each warlord relied on a band of loyal warriors, bound to him by oath along with promises of wealth and glory. These were recruited regardless of social status and place of origin, so it was common to have members of different tribes within a single warlord's retinue."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_campaign_fortify_wagon_laager"	"Many travelling groups have 'circled the wagons' over the centuries when attacked, from the pioneers travelling across the Great Plains of America all the way back to the steppe nomads of distant antiquity. While traditional nomad mobility is sacrificed, it is better to have some kind of fortress, no matter how weak, than be caught strung out on the march. A wagon may not seem like much of a defensive structure, but when it is all there is, it’s better than nothing. And in the middle of the empty steppes any advantage in a fight might have been the difference between victory and defeat."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_campaign_improve_mercenary_administration"	"The warriors of a barbarian tribe were sworn to follow their king and acting otherwise was deemed an unimaginably dire offence. For more ambitious military operations, however, it was insufficient to rely only on loyal warriors. In such cases, the king sought the service of hired fighters, usually of a type that the army was lacking. For example, nomadic horsemen were valued mercenaries for a number of barbaric hosts that lacked satisfactory cavalrymen. Mercenaries were closely watched though, as they could defect to a higher bidder at any time – even mid-battle!"	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_campaign_kidnap_foreign_siege_specialists"	"From the shores of Britannia to the vast Sarmatian steppes, the barbarian tribes were famous for their ferocity in battle, driven by bloodlust and desire for plunder. When it came to the more sophisticated method of siege warfare, however, they were laughably inadequate. Barbarians did besiege fortified settlements except when the defenders were too stubborn to instantly surrender – generally, the aggressors moved off again in search of easier prey. The Gothic leader Fritigern famously claimed, before leaving the Siege of Adrianople, that he had "no quarrel with stone walls". Any skill in siege warfare could come only from educated prisoners or slaves of civilised origin. In later centuries, the Huns were well aware of that, so siege engines came to complement their mounted armies, much to the dismay of their foes!"	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_campaign_live_off_the_land"	"Barbarian tribes believed fervently in the power of nature, especially that of wild beasts. By wearing wolf, bear or boar skins warriors could channel their power, be it speed, strength, or ferocity, in the heat of battle. Having a shared association with specific animals may also have created a brotherhood amongst warriors, who in effect became a pack. The Germanic tribes were known for their association with wolves, and wolf-warriors are even shown fighting as part of the Roman army on Trajan’s column in Rome."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_campaign_organize_pillaging"	"Unlike Romans, who often fought for conquest, barbarians usually fought for loot. When invading Roman lands, for example, once any local garrisons were either defeated or driven to retreat to an impregnable location, the barbarian force plundered any non-defended settlement in the vicinity. The war chief sometimes split his army into smaller parties for more efficient pillaging. These parties would proceed to comb the countryside for valuables. Success meant communication and scouting were of paramount importance in order to detect the approach of a retaliatory Roman force. Once a punitive army was near, raiding parties had to gather together and reassemble before deciding whether to give battle to the invading force or retreat."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_campaign_send_out_forage_parties"	"When fighting in foreign lands an army lives or dies on its foraging abilities. The ancient Celts were well aware of this fact and made it incredibly difficult for the Romans to gather food during their invasion. Should a careless general send a small party of men out to forage for food the tribes would make sure they were never seen again. After losing several parties this way, Caesar started sending entire Legions to guard his foragers."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_recruitment_adopt_clinkerbuilt_ships"	"The seafaring people of northern Europe came up with clinker-built ships around 2nd century AD, a technique which saw use well into the Middle Ages. Essentially, the method involves building a boat's hull with its outer planks overlapping each other. This kind of construction produced a lighter vessel as it displaced less water which, in turn, provided an increase in speed. Furthermore, a clinker-built ship withstood deeper waters well, as its construction could slightly twist and flex when battered by waves."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_recruitment_enchance_boat_construction"	"The model boats discovered in Celtic hoards not only give us an idea of how barbarian vessels may have looked, they also reveal the important role played by the sea in Celtic mythology. Bodies of water were seen as pathways to the Otherworld, and any islands found there were viewed as places of mystery and magic. The inhabitants of the British coast believed that a series of small islands in the Bristol Channel were Otherworldly realms. The magic of these islands can be explained, in part, by the sea mists that still obscure them from time to time, making them completely disappear."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_recruitment_gather_brave_souls"	"The barbarian warrior was brave in combat and loyal to his warlord – a combination that turned him into a dangerous enemy. His notion of war, however, was far from a complex military engagement lasting for months or even years; the ordinary barbarian fighter hoped for a single battle or several in quick succession. Once the fighting was over, he could retire to his home to enjoy the loot and renown he had gained. Defeats or lack of action caused warriors to become disgruntled, which often led to desertion. The bulk of an army on the march could abandon their king and accept the leadership of another simply because the former failed to put blood on their spears and gold in their pockets. Therefore, in order to maintain the momentum of a military campaign, the barbarian chieftain needed to keep fighting and winning."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_recruitment_implement_iron_anchors"	"The Celts were one of the first people to perfect the art of ironworking, creating weapons and beautiful artifacts that have survived to this day. It is not surprising then that they also used these skills to strengthen their ships. Iron bolts, which Caesar described as being “as thick as a man’s thumb”, were used to fix timbers; anchors pulled by strong iron chains were used to keep ships in place."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_recruitment_improve_cavalry_tactics"	"Although Roman writers often refused to acknowledge the skills possessed by the barbarians, there was one area of warfare which they freely admitted the Celts excelled at: horsemanship. The Greek historian Strabo stated that the finest cavalrymen in the whole Roman army were Celts; they were incredibly versatile troops, able to ride to any area they were needed and dismount to fight on foot. This was made easier by the cleverly-designed bridles worn by their horses, which had a small peg for staking into the ground to keep the horse in place while its rider fought."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_recruitment_instill_military_discipline"	"The majority of the barbarian tribes were usually depicted in historical sources as fierce yet ill-disciplined bands of savages. In his book 'Germania', Publicus Cornelius Tacitus gave account of the Chatti tribe. Unlike other Germans, he claimed, the Chatti were "…men of much sense and address." Tacitus then proceeded to explain that Chatti leaders rose through merit and for this reason their authority was respected all the more. The Chatti observed strict military discipline, knew how to keep formation in combat, how to create a proper camp for the night and how to plan a longer campaign. This resourcefulness did not diminish their individual bravery and bloodlust - the Chatti were known to leave their hair and beards grow and shave them off only after slaying an enemy."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_recruitment_intensify_physical_conditioning"	"In Sparta, baby boys were examined by its elders at birth. Those considered too weak were cast from Mount Taygetos, but the worthy faced a childhood designed to condition them for the physical demands of war. The 'agoge' training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and universally feared fighting force. If a boy survived to the age of thirteen he was subjected to a further seven years of formal military training until finally, aged twenty, he would be considered to have reached manhood, ready to become a true warrior of Sparta. This 'Gold Standard' set by the Spartans reverberated down the centuries, as successive powers trained elite forces as shock troops that could turn the tide of battle when deployed at the right moment."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_recruitment_lead_by_example"	"Barbarians were bound to their chief or king by a an oath and a strict code of loyalty. The code worked both ways, as the ancient historian Tacitus explains "...it is a disgrace for the chief to be surpassed in valour, a disgrace for his followers not to equal the valour of the chief." Thus a king needed to prove his merit as a leader at all times and likewise his warriors had to demonstrate their worth as followers. The Battle of Strasbourg at AD 357, between the Romans and the Alemanni, is a fine example of this relationship. Before the battle, the Alemanni king, Chnodomar, was urged by his warriors to dismount and fight on foot, as was proper for a true warrior. Naturally, he complied. After the Alemanni lost, however, Chnodomar surrendered to the Romans and his retinue did the same, as they could not bear the thought of outliving their leader."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_recruitment_oversee_young_bloods"	"His first battle was an intense experience for a barbarian youth. The budding warrior was eager to prove his courage and prowess in combat and yet keep his life, if possible. Most likely, such young fighters were placed somewhere in the battleline near their older relatives, who had more than a few battles under their belt. In this way, the beginner could learn by observing and following the personal example of someone who could actually tell the shaft of a battle axe from its blade."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_gothi_military_top_stand_together"	"Barbarians had a multitude of ways to show their ferocity in battle. One of these was the 'barritus' – a blood-curdling war cry delivered by Germanic armies right before combat commenced. It would start as a low hum and escalate into crescendo; a terrifying song yelled by barbarian warriors into the hollows of their shields to make it sound deeper and more intimidating. Such was the psychological effect of the barritus that Late Roman armies also adopted the use of the war cry."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_civil_culture_worship_wodanaz"	"The 'Interpretation Romana' matched the Germanic god Wodanaz to the Roman god Mercury, possibly because the two deities were depicted in a similar way  - wearing a hat and bearing a staff. In his work 'Germania', the Roman historian Tacitus claimed that the Germans "deem it right to sacrifice to him even with human victims". Little else is known of the god himself from that early period. In a few centuries, however, Wodanaz increased in prominence and complexity and came to be associated with wisdom and poetry. Still later, he became Odin, the Allfather, supreme lord of every other god in the Norse pantheon."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_civil_economy_exploit_natural_resources"	"The skill of ancient craftsmen is well known due to artefacts that have been discovered during archaeological excavations. Through their study and distinctive patterns, it has been possible to piece together a timeline of the emergence and expansion of the production methods used. By specialising in a particular skill or craft, a man's worth increased exponentially, and the items he produced became far more valuable than the cost of the materials used. This, in turn, guaranteed a livelihood for many."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_civil_economy_gift_slaves_to_nobility"	"Tacitus' Germania contains a treatise on slavery within the barbarian tribes. A slave was not assigned to specific tasks, as he would be in the Roman world, but to an entire household. The master of the household then expected the slave to provide him with certain goods, such as grain or cattle. Furthermore, in his maintenance duties, the slave was often helped by the wife and children of the master. Any kind of punishment, let alone a capital one, was a rare occurrence. All the same, slaves were a valuable commodity for the Germanic barbarians and it is quite possible that they were exchanged as gifts by prominent figures."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_civil_governance_proclaim_legendary_kingdom"	"The Marcomanni chose their kings based on nobility and military commanders based on valour. Neither of these two men ruled as a dictator however, as the kings did not have absolute, arbitrary power, and the commanders led by example, not by authority. Rome was content to support oligarchies that occasionally appeared among the Germanic peoples in order to prevent the establishment of strong states, but ancient kingship endured nonetheless. The king of noble birth was considered to be descended from divine royal ancestors, which were honoured for generations. On the other hand, a commander of warriors had to fight to achieve their status. A heroic triumph served as proof that a warrior was suitable to lead other men into battle. Under some circumstances, such a leader could found a new royal family, even if they had not been part of the nobility beforehand. A reiks with both the aspect of a nobleman and a war leader often attained legendary status among the local tribes - as great as the mighty Arminius or even the heroic Geat king of legend, Beowulf."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_civil_top_integrate_slaves"	"Slavery existed in barbarian tribes, particularly German ones, but differed from the Roman or eastern way. The chief source of slaves was captives taken in battle, but this is where the similarity between civilised and barbarian slavery ended. The barbarian slavemaster required a certain amount of grain, cattle, clothing and other such commodities from his slave, much like a tenant. Roman slaves, in comparison, were usually assigned to specific tasks and expected to do them exclusively. Furthermore, in barbarian lands, to strike a slave or lock them up in chains or force them into hard labour was a very rare occurrence. Slaves were often killed, not because they had disobeyed orders, but as a result of barbaric passion and savagery. In such cases, the killing of a slave would equal the killing of an enemy and the murderer faced no punishment. Freed men did not rank much higher than slaves and had little weight in society by default. A freed man however could gain the status of a regular tribesman or even a higher one if he acted with merit."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_military_battle_embrace_mother_night"	"According to Tacitus, the Harii were a tribe of savage warriors who preferred fighting at night. They would paint their bodies and shields black so that they blended into the darkness, then attack as an army of shadows. The Harii relied on the terror they instilled in their enemies, causing all but the most seasoned warriors to freeze in fear or run away screaming. It is believed that this tribe is the origin of the mythic 'einherjar' (literally 'one-time fighters'), ghostly Nordic warriors in the service of Odin. Other Germanic tribes likely adopted night raids as standard practice, as they were devastatingly effective at surprising and sacking smaller settlements and garrisons."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_military_battle_practice_war_dances"	"War dances allowed warriors to lose themselves in rhythm, clearing their minds and increasing their heart rate. This was particularly useful during battle, when an unfocused mind could get you killed. Each society had its own songs and dances; the Celts were known for advancing into battle with a rhythmic step, clashing their shields and shouting the name of their tribe. The Germanic tribes danced for a number of reasons, including honouring their dead, hailing a speech, gloating over a captured banner, or simply to celebrate a victory."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_military_battle_scout_settlements"	"A Germanic noble's main source of wealth was warfare, which allowed him to keep a large retinue. Military success and bountiful raids gave prestige to a leader in a society where all free men were warriors. Riches came to a noble quickly after victories, but a defeat made him disappear even more quickly, and defeat was very likely in the event of an organised Roman punitive expedition. These expeditions deployed scouting parties, a practice which wise Germanic nobles adapted for their own purpose. Using scouts to find rich, easy targets for a raid ensured that the noble wouldn't lose his wealth and retinue, but instead add to them."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_military_battle_train_with_longbows"	"In battle, Germanic barbarians used a variety of missile weapons. Javelins and throwing axes provided sufficient piercing power but lacked range. To overcome that, they used longbows, usually made of yew and fir wood. Sapwood was used for the outside of the bow while a different wood, tempered by heat, formed the inside. By this method, the sapwood resisted stretching, while the tempered wood resisted compression. Such bows were sturdier than their single-wood counterparts and shot arrows with much greater force."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_military_campaign_strip_them_bare"	"The Marcomanni were a strong Germanic tribal confederation that constantly threatened the northern borders of the Roman Empire. According to the historian Eutropius, Emperor Marcus Aurelius waged war for three years against Marcomanni warriors with the fortress of Carnuntum in Pannonia serving as his headquarters. This conflict against the German hordes would be later known as the Marcomannic Wars. The Roman Empire managed to attain victory, but never capitalised on it by expanding north of the Danube river. The battles won by the Marcomanni and their subsequent raids into Pannonia and Noricum confirmed their reputation as the most dangerous and savage of the Germanic tribes."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_marcomanni_military_top_incite_lust_for_battle"	"The Gaesatae were a group of elite Gallic warriors renowned for their ferocity. Their name roughly translates as 'spearman' and they fought as mercenaries against the Romans. Infamous for going into battle completely naked, an act that the Romans wrongly attributed to a desire to be unencumbered, it was actually a way for the Gaesatae to increase their contact with the earth. Greater contact with Mother Nature ensured their rebirth into the Otherworld should they perish in the mortal one."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_civil_culture_educate_emissaries"	"After assuming power, Zenobia focused on turning Palmyra into a centre of learning. Many intellectuals and scholars migrated to the city to serve in the royal court and in this way provide education. Gradually Greek, eastern and Egyptian ideas were bonded together in a school of thought considered a worthy successor of the philosophy developed by Hellenistic 'akademia'. Palmyra's intellectual prowess was particularly useful in political and diplomatic matters, where enlightened emissaries performed well by securing beneficial agreements for the state."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_civil_culture_exploit_diplomatic_opportunity"	"The turmoil of the Crisis of the 3rd Century in the Roman Empire produced so many problems for the central ruling body that its outer provinces were left to fend for themselves. Abandoned by their government, smaller settlements were at the mercy of bandits, raiders and invaders. This made the local governors susceptible to any emissary who promised protection. The new autonomous Roman states of Gallic Rome and Palmyra took advantage of this situation, bringing new territories full of willing subjects to their cause for a cheap price."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_civil_culture_finance_philosophers"	"The ancient scholars questioned the world around them and gradually began forming disciplines such as astronomy, geography, mathematics, medicine and philosophy to define their discoveries. Some of these early scholars went on to become the greatest thinkers of their day, forming schools to pass on their knowledge to others. The Egyptian city of Alexandria was the academic centre of the ancient world, home to a vast library of documentation and scrolls. It was a place of intellectual pilgrimage for all enquiring minds."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_civil_culture_promote_religious_tolerance"	"As a meeting ground of numerous beliefs, faiths and philosophies, eastern lands were often, but not always, tolerant of diversity. With many of the ruling elite Hellenistic in origin, it was common practice to mix both Greek and local customs in religious observances. Rather than enforcing their own view, rulers commonly allowed their people and any immigrant settlers to continue their own religious practices. Other empires, such as Parthia, were diverse collections of many kingdoms, each with their own beliefs, encompassing everything from Zoroastrianism to imperial cults of personality. As long as religion didn't cause disloyalty or late payment of taxes, all was well!"	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_civil_culture_uphold_palmyrean_gods"	"As you might expect, due to its geographical position and history Palmyra's pantheon was comprised of Semitic, Mesopotamian and Arabic gods and, in fact, reflected the multicultural nature of the Palmyrene people. The main pre-Hellenistic deity was named Bel, an abbreviation of the honorific Baal. Below the supreme deity were many ancestral Palmyrene gods, some of them unique to the city, such as the god of justice Yarhibol, the sun-god Malakbel and the moon god Aglibol. Priests of the deities were members of prominent families and wore distinctive headdresses to signify their religious authority."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_civil_economy_commence_grand_construction"	"Advancing architectural techniques, together with improved transport, removed some limits on monumental building works. With organised mass labour, monuments could be constructed on a vast scale. Egyptian tombs and pyramids are some of the earliest examples of monumental architecture in the ancient world. The Greeks built magnificent temples, triumphal arches and monumental columns, as did the Romans. Such monuments were often erected to honour deities or victorious leaders. In conquered lands, they were an effective way of overawing the subject population and reminding them of their loyalties."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_civil_governance_become_augusta"	"As a Palmyrene, Zenobia was accustomed to the multicultural diversity of the eastern provinces under the rule of her late husband. Even though the queen maintained Odaenathus's policies, she appeared to be more than simply an influential monarch. Zenobia embodied eastern magnificence, Hellenistic dignity and Roman power, and this blend gained her broad support for her cause. She was a true empress – wise and generous to her subjects, but a fierce warrior to her enemies."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_civil_governance_gain_favors"	"Monarchy was a new concept in Palmyra - the allegiance of surrounding cities was based on loyalty to the person of King Odaenathus, which hindered the succession of power after his assassination. Prince Vallabathus received all of his father's titles on paper yet his mother and regent, Queen Zenobia, was the true ruler of the 'Roman East'. As instability ruptured the Roman Empire, Zenobia saw that the only way to maintain a hold on the eastern provinces was to control them directly. Both her status and beauty helped her sway the local Roman officials and influential local noblemen to her side, who would be invaluable in the conflict to come."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_civil_top_become_regent"	"Queen Zenobia was determined to extend Palmyrene rule over the entire Roman world and realised that conquest and statecraft had to walk hand in hand to reach that goal.

In the eyes of her subjects, Zenobia shone as a benevolent ruler. Few realised that there was an iron hand within this velvet glove."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_military_battle_adhere_greek_warfare_traditions"	"Warfare occurred throughout the history of Ancient Greece, both between Greek city-states themselves and against external enemies such as Persia. Many military traditions from those days saw use for centuries to come, like the phalanx formation and companion cavalry. Slingers from Rhodos and archers from Crete were regularly used in Roman armies as auxiliaries. The spear was also a common weapon in the east, which meant that the Hellenistic approach to warfare lent itself well to Palmyrene armies. They could put the phalanx to great use, especially once its weaknesses had been addressed by the specialist, multicultural elements within its army."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_military_battle_seek_out_foreign_veterans"	"The Palmyrene army represented a curious mixture of various cultures, much like the capital city itself. The core of the troops were provided by wealthy citizens of Palmyra, the cavalry comprised heavily-armoured cataphracts and highly-mobile mounted archers. The numerous desert tribes then provided irregular troops proficient in guerrilla tactics. The extensive trading network gave access to exotic mercenaries, who came from as far as India to fight in Zenobia's army. The versatility of Palmyra's fighting force was one of the chief factors that helped establish it as a world power in the late 3rd century AD."	"True"

From the age of the Pharaohs to medieval times, Nubians were famed for their extraordinary archery skills, both when fighting on foot or mounted. In the 3rd century AD, as Palmyra proclaimed independence in the east and conquered lands from Egypt to Asia Minor, master marksmen from Nubia joined Queen Zenobia's forces, seeking wealth and glory in exchange for teaching Palmyrene archers the secrets of their art."

"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_military_campaign_compile_war_manuals"	"One of the reasons for Rome's great conquest was the meticulous recording of victories and successful military tactics. Roman historiography was founded by Quintus Pictor, who wrote a history of Rome to commemorate its victory in the Second Punic War. Writing historical books was a popular activity for upper class citizens, who deemed it an acceptable way to spend their retirement. This tradition also produced military scripture, such as Apollodorus' Poliorcetica – a treatise on siege warfare, probably dedicated to Emperor Trajan. Palmyra's status as a centre of learning meant that Zenobia could use the local academics to produce works of military strategy and tactics, a great boon to its already wealthy, well-equipped soldiers."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_palmyra_military_top_recruit_experienced_troops"	"The city of Palmyra had been a major trading hub for centuries before King Odaenathus laid the foundations of what was to become the Palmyrene Empire. Naturally, securing the continued flow of goods required an army that could serve as garrison for the city's independence to be guaranteed. Palmyrene forces were also expected to secure trade routes against bandits, either by escorting a caravan or carrying out preliminary strikes against marauding tribes. Most military campaigns were conducted in the desert, where rough terrain, combined with unbearable heat, demanded effective and precise logistics. All of these factors contributed to the martial competence of the Palmyrene soldier, regardless of whether he was a mounted archer or an infantry spearmen."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_culture_appease_the_masses"	"The blunt force behind Rome's economy were its numerous citizens, who maintained the farms, pastures, mines and markets that in turn fuelled Imperial might. The treasury's coffers were largely used to pay soldiers' wages, so other means were used to keep the morale of ordinary people high. Entertainment, spirituality and the famous Roman baths served to relieve the tension of hard work for the free Roman. Keeping the citizens calm was also a matter of politics, as parties sought to gain favour with the commoners by organising games or charity events."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_culture_dies_natalis_solis_invicti"	"After securing Imperial power, Aurelian reformed the Roman cult of Sol Invictus, elevating the sun-god to the status of premier divinity and a chief patron of soldiers. Each priest was given the title 'pontifex', which entailed induction into a new college of pontifices and Senatorial elites. Aurelian's agenda was to actively promote this faith throughout the Empire. To this end, he ordered the construction of a grand temple of Sol. Once the building was completed, its consecration took place on the 25th December. The same date was also marked by the 'Birthday of the Unconquered Sun' (or 'Dies Natalis Solis Invicti') – an annual festival dedicated to Sol Invictus. Running parallel to the festival, Aurelian instituted games in honour of the sun-god, held every four years."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_culture_elevate_roman_culture"	"Consensual contracts were introduced by the Romans and proved pivotal in their growth and prosperity as a trading nation. Contracts did exist prior to this point, but consensual contracts allowed transactions to take place without property changing hands: there merely needed to be consensus or agreement between the involved parties. There were four types: 'emptio-venditio' was a contract for the exchange of goods; 'locatio-conductio' was a contract for the hire of goods; while 'societas' governed partnerships. The final consensual contract was 'mandatum' which dealt with the commissioning of one party to carry out an activity that would benefit another without reward."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_culture_establish_sol_invictus"	"A united Empire needed something more than invasion-free borders and the flow of goods – an intangible component to entwine the hearts of the people and grant the Emperor an aura of undying authority. Emperor Aurelian made the cult of Sol Invictus (the Unconquered Sun) to be that unifying factor. The Emperor was already identified with the solar deity and, furthermore, sun-worship was common across much of the known world. This facilitated the absorption of new nations into a potentially-growing Empire."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_culture_gain_frumentarii_allegiance"	"Men of shadowy character were quite useful in the political world of Rome, where conspiracies and treacheries wove a complex web of shifting allegiances. Such men were the 'frumentarii' – wheat collectors working for the government who also acted as spies and a form of secret service to the Emperor. Their responsibilities included reconnaissance and sabotage, both within the Roman provinces and outside of their borders. As Rome splintered into three factions, it was unclear where the frumentarii's loyalties lay. Therefore. there was wisdom in reminding the spies that, in their very essence, they were servants of Rome."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_culture_organize_religious_prosecution"	"Before Christianity became the state religion of Rome in AD 313, Christians were often subject to discrimination. Religious disputes were not common in the Empire before Christianity came to its door, but this new faith was too aggressive in its expansion and denounced all other gods. In the 3rd century AD, Rome's Emperors were concerned with more fundamental issues within their territory and were reluctant to issue general laws against Christians. However, as Diocletian rose to power, persecution of Christians rapidly intensified. During his 15-year reign, he purged the army of Christians, condemned Manicheans to death, razed churches and burnt scriptures. The spark that seems to have ignited this oppression was the outburst of a Christian deacon, Romanus, who denounced a religious festival held at Antioch. Diocletian ordered the man's tongue removed and, enraged by the practices of such preachers, put in motion a policy of universal persecution."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_culture_promote_roman_traditions"	"The idea of the 'Imperial Cult', for the worship of Rome in the form of a Roman Emperor, started when Julius Caesar was officially given divine status by the Senate. His adopted son, Augustus, then went on to give himself the title of 'Pontifex Maximus', chief priest of the Roman state, and encouraged the construction of temples in his name. The reverence of a living Emperor was not practised in Rome itself, but throughout the rest of the Empire citizens had an obligation not only to serve the Emperor but also to swear allegiance to him as a figure of worship. This allowed Rome to unify its distant provinces and spread Roman culture."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_culture_secure_border_treaties"	"In order to weather the Crisis of the 3rd Century, the Roman Empire urgently needed allies, and sought to resolve matters through diplomacy whenever possible. For example, Germanic tribes in the north were looking to take advantage of the crumbling Roman state. A policy of dealing with barbarians without resorting to war had been practised in the past, when the Roman army had been stretched too thinly. The Empire sometimes conferred  the status of foederati upon specific tribes, granting them benefits and land within the Empire in exchange for military assistance along the borders."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_culture_send_diplomatic_gifts"	"More than military power, although that was often the leverage employed to get agreement, foreign policy in the ancient world encompassed diplomacy, treaties and tributes, the exchange and taking of hostages and prisoners, and trade. However, not everything was done for power, territory or wealth. In 22 BC, Phraates IV of Parthia was able to negotiate the return of his son, who had been kidnapped by the usurper Tiridates when he fled to Rome. In exchange for Phraates’ son, Augustus and the Senate were able to secure the return of the Eagles that had been lost at the disastrous Battle of Carrhae some thirty-three years earlier."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_economy_extend_labour_facilities"	"By perfecting concrete, a plentiful and cheap building material, the Romans were able to build structures quickly and without the need for vast teams of skilled craftsmen. Timber frames, or moulds, were used to provide a framework for the concrete walls; constructing them was a task that could be done by a relatively unskilled labourer. The frameworks could also be re-used, making the whole process relatively cheap, quick and efficient. This could prove vital in times of war when defensive structures needed to be built quickly."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_economy_focus_on_local_production"	"Many historians believe that the increase in production of consumables like pottery and jewellery in Celtic society was directly linked to an increase in contact with Rome. Trade with Rome had its benefits, and tribal leaders began to use their resources to make trade goods. Iron from Britain made it as far afield as Carthage in north Africa, proving that the ancient Celts knew more about trade than Roman writers, such as Caesar and Strabo, believed."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_economy_implement_monetary_reformation"	"In tumultuous times, Rome's Emperors often ordered the minting of additional coins, usually of lower value as silver was diluted with bronze and copper to increase the quantity produced. The debased money was usually then spent to secure the army support, on which troubled Emperors were heavily dependent. Aurelian attempted to revive the faltering Roman economy by recalling all the old coins and introducing new ones that contained more silver. The financial situation had been so dire that the new antoninianus coin, containing only 5% silver (a meagre amount compared to old silver denarius), was a significant improvement over its predecessor."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_economy_invest_in_manufacturing"	"As ever-increasing populations demanded more goods it became necessary to explore the principles of mass-production. This led to the development of piecework: the construction of component parts that could be produced quickly and in large quantities. Teams of workers would then assemble these parts into goods. Roman philosopher and writer, Pliny the Elder, tells of shops dedicated to the production of individual chandelier parts. There is also evidence to suggest that factory-like production was used in urban areas for the manufacture of pots, building parts and military items."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_economy_procure_egyptian_grain"	"The province of Aegyptos was by far the wealthiest Roman province in the east. It was the primary supplier of grain for the Empire, which grew increasingly dependent on its production. Although most of the agricultural advancements in the ancient world were introduced by the Romans, the simple truth was that they couldn’t feed themselves. Written records indicate that more than 8 million bushels of grain were imported from Aegyptos on an annual basis. By the end of the 3rd century AD, the needs of the Empire exceeded even the capacity of the fertile fields of the Nile. To combat this food crisis, new reforms established a tighter control over production, which led to an increased number of exports at the expense of the overworked Egyptian people – the grain must flow!"	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_economy_regulate_commerce"	"The Greek philosopher Plato stated that all merchants, by their nature, were driven by greed and proposed the creation of an institution that could regulate the price of grain and all other goods. The Romans, ever wary of the greed of their merchants, fixed grain prices during shortages and even passed pricing edicts that looked to dictate a fixed value for all goods across the Empire. Emperor Diocletian’s price edit of AD 301 laid out a huge list of set prices which, if broken, were punishable by execution for the merchant and the buyer."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_economy_restore_markets"	"The science of measurement, metrology, was invented by the Egyptians during the Bronze Age. Its creation was inspired by a lust for money as Pharaoh Sesostris wanted to measure and tax his subjects' arable land. Units of measurement were typically based on parts of the human body or a man’s capacity: the digit, palm, foot and pace for example. Not surprisingly there were many local variations, but as trade between cities and states increased there were attempts to introduce standard quantities of everything. The Greek king Pheidon is widely recognised as the creator of the first set of agreed common weights and measures."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_economy_restrict_the_coloni"	"The 'coloni' were tenant farmers who leased land from a landowner in exchange for a portion of the crops. While technically free citizens, their position at the end of the 3rd century AD was akin to slaves. Emperors Diocletian and Constantine further worsened the coloni's plight by enacting a series of laws imposing further restrictions on them. For example, they were no longer permitted to leave the land they ploughed. This ensured that farms remain cultivated and thus taxed, which in turn provided Emperors with a secure budget and future revenue."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_economy_seize_the_imperial_treasury"	"To be successful, a bid for power needed the backing of sizeable coffers. Gold could breathe loyalty into the troops, secure well-being for the citizens and seal support from the allies. The Roman Emperor had at his disposal the 'Aerarium', the public treasury. It contained all of the state monies and accounts, public laws, Senatorial decrees and other papers of importance. Under imperial rule, the Senate maintained a nominal management over general taxes and ordinary expenditure, as well as special funds from spoils of war and veterans' retirement benefits. As the Emperor's power and jurisdiction grew, however, the Senate's authority over finances was reduced to little more than a formality."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_governance_assume_power"	"The capture of Emperor Valerian in AD 260 delivered the single blow that fractured the Roman Empire, causing Palmyra and the Gaul  to secede and declare autonomy. In Rome, Aurelian was hailed the new Emperor by the troops, due to his illustrious career as a soldier and commander of the cavalry. The western provinces, however, elected Postumus to lead a new Roman state. He remained on the throne for ten years, before being murdered by his own troops. The reigns of his two successors, Marius and Victorinus, were short and insignificant, but then Gaius Tetricus, a capable statesman, took over. In Palmyra, the mighty local king, Odaenathus, was initially loyal to the Roman Empire, but his assassination left the power in the hands of his queen, Zenobia, as regent. She then seized her chance to conquer Rome's eastern provinces for herself and her son Vaballathus."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_governance_consolidate_power"	"Taking power in any great state is an endless and strenuous endeavour, especially in Rome. The Imperial history is riddled with ambitious Senators and generals, who ascend to the throne only to have their rule toppled in four seasons or less. Great leaders recognised the importance of not only attaining the ultimate power, but also retaining that position. In his quest to reunite a broken nation, the Soldier-Emperor Aurelian did his best to win the support of both troops and lowly citizens alike by cancelling debts to the Treasury and making a public bonfire of the relevant records. The Senate were wary of their brazen Emperor, but little could be done to resist him, as he enjoyed the support of his subjects."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_governance_defend_the_empire"	"After becoming Emperor, Aurelian found himself beset by enemies on all sides. Whole provinces broke away from his rule and formed autonomous states both in the east and the west. Beyond the newly established state of Palmyra lay Sassanid Persia, the ancient Roman rival with a new face, always probing for a chance to conquer. From the north, the constant threat of the Germanic tribes loomed closer, as they sought to plunder the unstable Roman state. Defending against these external perils seemed hopeless, but Rome had endured in the past and would do so again. In his wisdom, the Emperor initiated the construction of a wall around Rome itself – a last yet impenetrable line of defence."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_governance_delegate_power"	"By introducing a set of laws that were not entirely subject to the whims of the ruler, legal institutions provided a framework of rules dictating how wealth could and should be distributed. Some of the greatest advances in this area were put forward by a jurist known simply as 'Gaius'. He wrote many great works on the finer points of Roman law, but he is best known for his work 'The Institutions of Gaius'. It was broken into four sections that discussed how people, things, intestate succession and actions should be governed by law."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_governance_expand_city_planning"	"Roman urban planning was based on centuries long Greek tradition and stout Roman logic. The methods of building a new city and constructing a military camp were more or less the same. First, the two main streets were laid out. One of them ran from the east to the west – 'decumanus maximus'. It was intersected by the 'cardo maximus' which had a  south-north orientation. In the middle, where the two avenues intersected, which Roman architects designated an area for the city forum. From this basic structure, all other streets spread out at right angles, forming square-shaped districts or 'insulae'; they contained living quarters, shops and possibly smaller alleys between buildings. Further expansion and development of the settlement followed the same principles and many Roman towns served as a foundation for later medieval and even modern cities."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_governance_fund_communal_garbage_service"	"The ancient Greeks established the first communal dump in Athens around 400 BC. A special law prohibited throwing rubbish into the streets and decreed that waste was to be carried at least a mile away from the city. A few centuries later, the Romans introduced the first communal rubbish collection service – two men with a wagon would walk the streets and take care of the citizens' household waste. Considering the terrible plagues that devastated the Empire, such as the outbreaks during the 3rd century AD, efforts to sanitise the ancient world were appropriate."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_governance_ogranize_construction_projects"	"As building materials became more understood, and skills developed amongst architects and builders, new construction techniques became possible. Domes, arches and vaults became regular features in Roman architecture, but a true dome was perhaps the pinnacle achievement of architects and builders of the time. They posed complex puzzles when it came to supporting the weight of the structure as it was being built, and it took time and a certain amount of trial and error for architects to perfect the system. The Pantheon in Rome is one of the best examples of a true dome and suggests that by AD 128 architects had mastered the form."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_governance_prosecute_official_misconduct"	"In order to secure stable reign, an Emperor often had to turn a blind eye to governmental officials whose purses were full due to deeds of dubious honesty. The reason was simple – although corrupt people were criminals, they could still be useful to the Empire. However, a few exceptions need to be mentioned. Emperor Aurelian, for example, was notorious for his strict adherence to discipline and law. When he found out that workers in the Imperial mint were stealing silver and producing low quality coins, he sentenced Felicissimus, the 'rationalis' or mint overseer, to death. This caused an uproar among the mint workers and they openly rebelled. Without hesitation, Aurelian ordered his 'cohorts urbanae' to deal with the mob. The revolt was crushed after a gory battle on the Caelian Hill. Many of the surviving rebels were executed along with any man foolish enough to support the rebellion. Aurelian’s justice had prevailed."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_governance_restore_rome_glory"	"As the seat of power in a vast empire, the city of Rome was the largest urban centre in the known world. Around 20 percent of the population under jurisdiction of the Roman Empire lived in the city's immeasurable housing. This amounts to approximately one million citizens, visiting tradesmen and craftsmen aside. In military, economic, spiritual and political aspects, Rome was truly the heart of the Empire. Its fortifications, markets and temples were acknowledged as an example for all future cities to follow. Control over Rome was crucial during times of crisis, for whoever held the greatest city had a chance to rule the entire world."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_civil_top_restore_imperial_rule"	"Aurelian was born a simple peasant’s son, but after enlisting in the army he rose quickly through the ranks all the way to general. Distinguished by peerless courage and stern discipline, he served as general under the Emperors Gallenus and Claudius Gothicus. After attaining the purple, Aurelian ruled for only a few years, yet he accomplished a series of hard-earned achievements, the most notable of which are, indubitably, his military victories, which led to the reunification of the splintered Roman Empire. His wartime successes however were backed by decisive civil changes including monetary reformation, food supply reorganisation and the establishment of the Sol Invictus cult."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_battle_adopt_foreign_tactics"	"Barbarians had a multitude of ways to show their ferocity in battle. One of these was the 'barritus' – a blood-curdling war cry delivered by Germanic armies right before combat commenced. It would start as a low hum and escalate into crescendo; a terrifying song yelled by barbarian warriors into the hollows of their shields to make it sound deeper and more intimidating. Such was the psychological effect of the barritus that Late Roman armies also adopted the use of the war cry."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_battle_integrate_foederati"	"In the days of the Roman Republic, the term 'foedus' described a treaty between Rome and any non-Roman tribe. The tribe was free to keep their administrative independence in exchange for providing troops. Thanks to these agreements, Rome managed to consolidate its power over the Italian peninsula. The 'foedus' saw wide use after the turbulent 3rd century AD, when vast hordes of barbarians approached Roman frontiers. The Emperors initially hired barbarian soldiers to fight under the Imperial banner, but later on allowed whole tribes to settle in border areas in order to defend them against third-party incursions."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_battle_issue_centurion_training"	"The 3rd century AD introduced significant changes to internal command structure of the Roman army. For example, promotion was tied to length of service, which often outweighed merit and hard work. After a man had finished his period as a recruit, he was assigned either to the cavalry or the infantry, attaining a status of a non-commissioned officer. Further transfer of soldiers between military units was discouraged. A soldier could sever his ties to the unit into which he was recruited only after he had attained at least the rank of cadet officer. Among the officers, seniority was the leading factor for command. The title of 'primus pilus', or 'first spear', went to the commander of the first cohort and the most senior centurion of a Legion."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_battle_motivate_hirelings"	"Subsistence in small settlements became increasingly harder as the Roman Empire fell into crisis. Many villages were left defenceless and had to fend for themselves. Bandits, pirates and rogue military regiments were a common occurrence, some of them forming large companies and becoming strong enough to be recognised as a threat to smaller states. With the proper 'encouragement', they could be persuaded to fight as mercenaries, supporting the military effort of the highest bidder – the right amount of gold can make a band of raiders fight with impressive fervour."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_battle_refine_naval_artillery"	"The Hellenistic world was at the forefront of construction when it came to huge war galleys bristling with artillery. Alexander the Great used catapults from his ships when he besieged Tyre in 332 BC, and it was the Greeks who built the most formidable floating fortress of the time, the Syracusia. Designed by inventor Archimedes, this huge transport vessel was said to be 55 metres in length. It featured a raised fighting deck that housed a giant catapult capable of switching between firing a five metre dart or an 80 kilogramme stone missile."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_battle_reforge_legion_aquillae"	"The aquila was a prominent symbol in Rome and the standard of many Roman Legions. For each Legion, a single Legionary, known as an aquilifer, was entrusted with carrying the standard. This Eagle-bearer, as they were mentioned in Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico, had a great effect on the Legion's morale in the most perilous engagements, shouting out to the troops and leading them into battle. Losing its Eagle meant great disgrace for a Legion, and so the Romans went to great lengths to protect these sacred objects. After the humiliating defeat at Teutoburg Forest, Roman search parties scoured the woods in an attempt to find and retrieve the standards of the three lost Legions."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_battle_research_siege_equipment"	"Siege towers were great feats of engineering, sometimes reaching six storeys in height. Any defenders seeing one approaching would instantly do all in their power to halt its advance. Flaming arrows and boiling oil were obvious choices; their use led the Romans to develop defensive countermeasures. Wet cow skins were often fixed to the tower's frame and men were stationed inside, equipped with water hoses made of pickled cow intestines to put out fires."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_battle_train_boarding_parties"	"The Imperial Roman army was, indubitably, the most powerful military force of its time. Its navy, however, was less impressive – shipbuilding and naval tactics were not the Romans' natural strengths. Fortunately, during the days of the Empire, relatively few maritime engagements occurred. Still naval warfare evolved. By the 2nd century AD, ramming tactics had completely disappeared along with the quick and mobile trireme. The naval ram was replaced by a long spur in the bow, used to break the oars of enemy vessels and serve as a boarding platform. To ensure successful boarding actions, infantrymen – 'marines' – were trained to fight on unstable ground such as the decks of enemy ships."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_battle_utilize_elite_alae"	"Heavy infantry remained the backbone of the Roman army throughout its history. During the massive Crisis of the 3rd century, however, cavalry rose to prominence. Horsemen boasted greater mobility than footmen and could react to critical situations much quicker.

Among these were the charge of the iron-clad cataphract horsemen and harassment by highly-mobile mounted archers."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_campaign_adopt_defenseindepth_strategy"	"'Defence in Depth' is a theory held amongst some historians that Roman defensive military strategy evolved in the 4th century AD from the previous ideology of 'preclusive defence'. Preclusive defence was Rome's method of neutralising incursions by stationing units along its border, as well as in forward outposts, to trap enemy forces that came between them in a pincer movement. However, Roman borders became too vast to defend properly in this manner and this led to the development of defence in depth, a technique whereby the enemy army is given some ground over a large area, weakening its supply logistics as it spreads itself too thinly. Then, its weaker positions are attacked by the defending army, with the intention of repelling the enemy back to its original position - outside the boundaries the strategy was intended to defend."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_campaign_coordinate_military_effort"	"Any army, either permanent or temporary, required extensive administration in order to function; food supply and shelter had to be secured, all day to day activities needed to be recorded. Wide-scale military efforts put additional strain on army commanders, as they had to maintain coordination with other armies or the civilian population. These tasks were the duty of praetorian prefects, who tended to sustenance, transportation and keeping records. Taxation was the chief source of food supplies, with contributions being based on local farming yields and needs of the local army. The shattering of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century AD caused food shortages in multiple settlements, turning the soldiers into a starving, mutinous menace!"	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_campaign_employ_barbarian_auxiliaries"	"In AD 212, Emperor Caracalla issued the famous edict 'Constitutio Antoniniana', bestowing Roman citizenship upon every free person living within the boundaries of the Roman Empire. The most likely purpose of the edict was to increase the number of tax payers and therefore revenue. While the fiscal benefits of the edict are uncertain, it brought a side effect - many non-Romans were, for the first time, allowed to enrol in the army. Historians still debate whether this process of 'barbarisation' contributed to the diminishing of Rome's military power during the Crisis of the 3rd Century."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_campaign_enforce_conscription"	"The Roman army in the 3rd century AD was gradually depleted by a combination of external attacks, internal strife, economic hardships and even plague. Volunteers from amongst the Roman populace were relatively scarce, as fewer and fewer people were willing to risk injury or death in exchange for a lowly soldier's wage. Recruits from barbarian tribes, on the other hand, were easy to find and were eager to serve Rome and get paid in the process. As military promotions came as a direct result of a person's merit, in time, many high-ranking Roman officers were of barbarian descent."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_campaign_improve_mercenary_administration"	"Mercenaries have existed for thousands of years but the earliest written record of them dates back to the 7th century BC, when Greek hoplites sought employment as bodyguards serving Pharaohs and Greek tyrants alike. Mercenaries became a great way to bolster troop numbers during times of war, something to which the Carthaginians resorted during their war with Rome. They exploited their trade links to recruit troops from the Iberian peninsula and the Balearic islands. The Romans were more sparing with their use of mercenaries, but acknowledged the shortcomings within the Legion, notably archers and cavalry, by making up for the lack with carefully chosen mercenary troops."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_campaign_organize_armatura_drill"	"Each army had its own training methods. Nations with hoplite-heavy armies believed dancing and athletics were sufficient to prepare a man for battle. Roman generals took a slightly different view. Legionaries trained with a wooden sword, twice the weight of a battle weapon, against a wooden post. They would train for hours, practising stabs, thrusts and feints against their immobile opponents. This would then progress to fencing practice with other recruits, using swords with covered tips, before the finely-honed weapon skills were taken into full mock battles."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_campaign_rebuild_camps"	"The intensity of barbarian invasions in the 3rd century AD forced the Roman Empire to re-evaluate its defensive strategy, which had, up to that point, consisted of punitive campaigns and pre-emptive strikes into enemy lands. As Rome came to fight invaders on its own territory, appropriate defensive measures were needed. Emperor Gallienus (AD 253-268) instituted the comitatenses units, which were widely used by later Emperors such as Diocletian and Constantine. The comitatenses were comprised of various troop types and were kept in reserve, away from the frontier. Their goal was to react to an enemy incursion once it had broken through border fortifications."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_campaign_reorganize_siege_provisions"	"As populations grew and the demand for food increased, long-term storage of grain became vital. With improved transport allowing for the movement of grain, it became possible to construct vast storage warehouses to hold shipped-in food stock. The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or 'horrea' were built along the embankment of the River Tiber in an area known as the Emporium district."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_campaign_set_up_fabricae"	"During the Principate period of Roman history, arms manufacture was left to the army and civilian craftsmen. Later, as the Roman Empire expanded and grew, conflicts emerged in all four corners of its territory. Subsequently, the army faced great difficulties in procuring equipment when stationed far away from the core Latin provinces. Many Legionary outposts and urban centres were then turned into 'fabricae', or state arms factories. These establishments were also tailored to the needs of the local regiments. Western provinces had 'sagittaria' and 'arcuaria' fabricae, which specialised in bows and arrows. Eastern factories produced equipment for the local 'clibanarii' and 'catafractarii', the heavily-armoured cavalry units. After all, Rome owed its military success to the organisation and discipline of its soldiers, values that were then applied to arms manufacture."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_recruitment_apply_renumeration_reforms"	"The military reforms of Gaius Marius marked a significant change in pay for Roman soldiers. Legionaries did not consider the new annual salary of 100 denarii, complimented by payment in land or cash up to 3,000 denarii, suitable payment for 25 years hard service. Veteran troops looked to their Consuls, frequently their former generals, for more suitable recompense for their efforts, causing inevitable political unrest and eventually, civil war. Emperor Augustus restored stability in the 1st century BC and was quick to identify the role that the dissatisfied Legions had played in the years of strife. He set up the Aerarium Militare, the Military Treasury, a pot of money initiated by his own funds and topped up by regular citizen tax payments; it provided soldiers with a pension equivalent to 14 years' pay."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_recruitment_employ_skilled_engineers"	"Ship construction in the ancient world developed in response to the perceived need for bigger, stronger vessels. Double planking allowed the ancient shipwrights to build vast, strong hulls whilst keeping the ships light and manoeuvrable. The technique used two types of wood, with the inner layer constructed from a softer material than the exterior. In some cases a layer of lead separated the two woods in vulnerable areas of the ship, while cloth or wool soaked in wax would also be placed between the layers to add waterproofing."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_recruitment_expand_tactical_exercises"	"As armies adopted flexible forces, subdivided into units, each with their individual function and strengths, tactical drills became the difference between victory and defeat. Layered tactical manoeuvres could be planned and executed to counter any enemy and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC. Here the Romans effortlessly moved as one to create open lanes in their formation, allowing the rampaging beasts to charge harmlessly through their ranks."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_recruitment_form_vexillationes"	"In the army of the Roman Empire, the word 'vexillatio' initially denoted a detachment of troops from a Roman Legion. Commanders formed such detachments to deal with situations that did not require the full strength of a Legion. A 'vexillatio' acted as a very mobile unit and could be raised from a parent Legion and integrated back into it relatively quickly. In the turbulent times of the 3rd century AD, however, the Roman army suffered from a lack of cohesion and 'vexillationes' turned into nigh-on autonomous units with poor coordination and doubtful efficiency. Later on, during the rule of Emperor Diocletian, the system was abandoned and the term 'vexillatio' was used to designate cavalry units."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_recruitment_improve_harbour_infrastructure"	"During the rule of Julius Caesar, new harbours were constructed near Rome as a means to improve the grain supply to the city. As the 3rd century AD unleashed its days of chaos and violence on the Roman Empire, bandits and pirates ravaged the smaller villages and the destitute populace abandoned their homes. Large cities grew in size due to the influx of refugees, which threatened the infrastructure and food supply of the locals. Following the example of Rome's port in Ostia, coastal Roman settlements put the people to work on improving their wharfs and ships. Others were recruited in the harbour garrison to learn the ways of naval warfare and apply them against the enemies of Rome."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_recruitment_intensify_physical_conditioning"	"In Sparta, baby boys were examined by its elders at birth. Those considered too weak were cast from Mount Taygetos, but the worthy faced a childhood designed to condition them for the physical demands of war. The 'agoge' training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and universally feared fighting force. If a boy survived to the age of thirteen he was subjected to a further seven years of formal military training until finally, aged twenty, he would be considered to have reached manhood, ready to become a true warrior of Sparta. This 'Gold Standard' set by the Spartans reverberated down the centuries, as successive powers trained elite forces as shock troops that could turn the tide of battle when deployed at the right moment."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_recruitment_practise_strategic_maneouvres"	"While battles were traditionally fought on vast, open landscapes, there were exceptions and a clever strategist could use these to his advantage. Terrain was an effective form of defence, with high ground, woods and forests used to protect the rear and flanks of an army, particularly when faced with a cavalry-heavy opponent. Such features also offered cover for ambush attacks, and knowledge of their terrain became a key factor in the success of the Germans and Gauls who used guerrilla tactics to counter the organised ranks of the Roman army."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_recruitment_reorganize_the_cohorts"	"General Gaius Marius introduced radical reforms which changed how the Roman army was recruited and structured, and therefore how it fought in battle. The Legion’s manipular organisation was scrapped with the 'cohort' becoming the basic unit. A Legion consisted of ten cohorts of 480 men each rather than 30 maniples; each cohort was divided into six centuries of 80 men. This was later raised to a nominal strength of 600, with each century having 100 men; casualties meant that this was rarely the case in practice. Marius also reformed the weaponry and fighting methods of the Roman army. Every man was equipped identically, with the spears of the triarii disposed of, to be replaced by shield, pilum-style javelins and the gladius."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_recruitment_restore_imperial_navalia"	"The first Roman naval military bases, or 'navalia', were constructed in the vicinity of Rome itself – the 'navalia superiora' and 'navalia inferiora'. As the Republic transformed into the Empire, however, they were no longer in use and a large portion of the Roman maritime might was concentrated at the coastal city of Ravenna - sources claim that up to 250 ships could be stationed in its large harbour. At some point during 2nd century AD, the port was moved to the nearby town of Classe. Later on, the Crisis of the 3rd century saw the region sacked twice. Afterwards, the importance of Ravenna and its port faded and more than a century passed before its complete recovery."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_rome_military_top_march_to_rome"	"Aurelian's hagiography is initially that of a typical barracks-Emperor. Starting out as a simple soldier, he rose rapidly through the ranks and attained command of the elite Dalmatian cavalry. Under Claudius II, Aurelian and his horsemen were instrumental in thwarting Germanic and Gothic invasions in Italy and the Balkans. After an outbreak of the plague claimed Claudius' life, Aurelian was instantly proclaimed Emperor by his troops. His first challenge was to face the other claimant for the title, Claudius' brother Quintillus. Overcoming him guaranteed control over the city of Rome."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_culture_expand_your_royal_harems"	"The royal harem during the reign of the Sassanid dynasty was based on the institution established during Achaemenid days. In both cases, the Shahanshah was allowed by law to marry any number of wives. Among them, one was given the title of 'chief wife' – she was the mother of the heir to the throne. All other harem members were organised according to a system of five ranks and bore titles ranging from 'Royal Princess' to 'Queen of Queens'. It is notable that the chief wife was not always the 'Queen of Queens'. The harem was supervised and maintained by eunuchs, who often held great military or civic authority."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_culture_hire_royal_astronomers"	"For the Persians, astronomy and astrology were a single science that sought the answers to two questions. The first was “What is the pattern of motion of sun, moon and stars\?” and the second: “What is their meaning\?” While the former question intrigued the ancient stargazers, the Shahanshah was interested mainly in the latter. Historical sources relate that astrologers revealed to Ardashir I, before he even thought to found the Sassanid dynasty, that he had been born under a fortunate star and was going to be a king. Because of this event, royal astrologers were tasked with compiling an elaborate horoscope whenever a new ruler ascended to the throne."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_culture_impress_your_magnificence"	"The creation of an official state religion allowed the rulers of the eastern kingdoms to rapidly establish control, officially blurring the lines between church and state and increasing the power and control of both institutions at the same time. For example, in Sassanid Persia the Avesta, the primary set of Zoroastrian religious texts, was revived as the faith experienced a surge in the ideological power it wielded. In this way, the priesthood grew to have influence over military and judicial matters as well. By the same token, the king was able to do whatever he wanted as long as he had ‘divine sanction’ - the official approval of Ahura Mazda through his priesthood."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_culture_institute_festival_fire"	"In Zoroastrianism, fire is a holy symbol, related to concepts of truth and cleansing. Every Sassanid Shahanshah minted coins upon which, along with his own visage, an image of a fire altar was engraved. In some cases the ruler was depicted as tending the fire, either alone or in the company of his wife, son or another important figure. The Shahanshah was most likely involved in the celebration of Zoroastrianism although the addition of new rites and traditions on top of ancient ones was relatively rare."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_culture_persecute_manicheans"	"Manichaeism was a gnostic religious movement heralded by the prophet Mani during the 3rd century AD. Borrowing concepts from Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Christianity, Manichaeism preached about an ongoing conflict between good and evil which corresponded to spirituality as opposed to the material world. While the Sassanid ruler Hormizd I was accepting of Manichaean teachings, his successor Bahram persecuted followers of the faith, even executing Mani the prophet, with a level of cruelty that varies according to different sources. It is also possible that the influential Zoroastrian priest Kartir orchestrated Mani’s demise by manipulating the Shahanshah."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_culture_preserve_zendavesta"	"According to tradition, the prophet Zoroaster received twenty-one books, created by the deity Ahura Mazda himself. The books formed the Zoroastrian holy scripture, the Avesta. As the Achaemenid dynasty of ancient Persia adopted Zoroastrianism, the Avesta came to be housed in a library at Persepolis, written with golden ink on parchments and leather sheets. Alexander the Great put Persepolis to the torch in 330 BC and the sacred texts were lost. Centuries later, the Sassanids restored the Avesta by piecing together fragments of the original text and filling in the blanks with oral traditions. Such a magnificent feat probably took years to accomplish yet it became a spiritual monument to Sassanid devotion to Zoroastrianism."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_culture_proclaim_support_kartir"	"The Shahanshah was a figure illustrious and wise, almost divine in his magnificence. Yet even a truly enlightened person could still reap the benefit of advice given by counsellors who were prudent and loyal in their intentions. Certainly, working for the exalted Shahanshah bestowed great wealth, power and influence aplenty upon his advisors and there were certain especially gifted individuals among them who managed to hold their esteemed position for a very long time. One such advisor was the Zoroastrian priest Kartir, who was counsellor to four Sassanid rulers – Ardashir, Shapur, Hormizd and Bahram."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_culture_restructure_order_magi"	"Historical sources claim that the Parthians distorted the teachings of Zoroastrianism by mixing them with practices from other religions and cults. When Ardashir I of the Sassanids ascended to the throne, he realised that the faith was in chaos. He summoned all priests from his realm to a grand discussion to reveal the true nature of Zoroaster’s legacy. Reportedly, eighty thousand priests arrived, but after the lengthy debate their number was reduced to seven – those with the deepest knowledge and purest piety. Even if this story is not true, it gives us a notion of the religious reforms of the Sassanid era."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_culture_venerate_Shapur_I"	"The second Sassanid Shahanshah, Shapur I, was a powerful ruler who reigned from AD 240 to AD 270. He stabilised Sassanid rule over the lands of former Parthia and extended his dominion as far as Antioch and the Mediterranean coast. In the process, he scored many victories against the Romans and achieved the singular feat of capturing a Roman Emperor in battle. In addition to his martial prowess, Shapur I was known as a tolerant ruler, who maintained friendly relations with the various minorities living within his lands. He initiated many great construction projects, using captured Roman soldiers as slave labour for some of them. As for the spiritual side of his rule, suffice to say that Shapur I strengthened Zoroastrianism as the dominating religion of his state. In short, this was a ruler completely deserving of his successor's adoration."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_economy_control_silk_roads"	"The trade between Persia and China was of paramount importance to the Sassanids, with the goods travelling along the Silk Road constituting a colossal amount to the Persian economy. Defence of the caravans was key, therefore, to ensure both that trade was successful and that his Chinese trading partners were aware of how much the Shahanshah valued them. As well as caravanserai - lodging-houses and inns where weary traders could rest - the Sassanids also set up fortresses and outposts along the road to deter bandits and robbers from attempting to loot the caravans. In this way the trade routes were maintained and guarded, and the goods could flow."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_economy_create_your_royal_bazaars"	"The bazaar was the throbbing heart of the eastern city, bustling with activity day and night as services and goods were constantly traded for their equivalent in gold and silver. During the rule of the Sassanids, bazaars also accommodated craftsmen and artisans alongside simple vendors. The craftsmen and artisans either worked individually or applied for membership of guilds. Each guild was led by a master craftsman of singular skills whose duty it was to coordinate the work of its members. Above the guilds stood the 'Wazarbed' or head of the bazaar - a representative of royal authority that supervised the general activity of the marketplace."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_economy_extend_your_royal_benevolence"	"The Parthian model of governance was very laissez-faire, with numerous satrapies swearing loyalty to the Parthian monarch but acting almost entirely independently, only feeding back support and wealth to the Arsacid rulers. Whilst the satraps invariably rose as one to fight when called upon, the Parthian system allowed the high noble families to exercise vast control over the empire and the Arsacid kings. Ardashir I, the first Sassanid king, placed greater emphasis on the role of the state across the empire. He settled new cities in his name, and renamed old provinces, populating them with his own people. In this way, he created regional headquarters for central administration, pushing his ideology and doctrines across the empire in a more stratified manner."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_economy_hire_roman_translators"	"As trade networks between countries and regions grew, the language of trade evolved. Merchants were no longer dealing with men from the next town over: vast trade routes like the 'Silk Road' linked Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe. Language skills became almost as valuable as spices. In eastern kingdoms, Aramaic remained the recognised language of trade, but a knowledge of the basics of Greek and Latin became essential as many goods, particularly spices, became sought after commodities in the west."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_economy_implenet_your_terraced_fields"	"With an ongoing struggle to collect and harness water supplies to irrigate their fields in arid climates, eastern civilisations turned to terracing in order to utilise land on hills and mountainsides. Narrow fields, formed as steps in the sloping land, allowed hillsides to be farmed with little risk of soil erosion. Each step, or field, was irrigated by a network of canals. In Mesopotamia, terraced fields were irrigated by a network of 'shadufs' which were placed on each step. This simple ancient water-lifting device was made up of a large beam, supporting a rope and bucket, with a counter weight at the opposite end."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_economy_plan_your_grand_canals"	"Agriculture in the east was often blighted by erratic rainfall in a harsh landscape. Farmers soon realised that irrigation systems, like canals and dams, were ideal for storing and transporting the water they needed for 'dry-farming' in these areas. In Mesopotamia, the Euphrates and Tigris rivers were unpredictable and could often swell after sowing season, flooding the crops. Storage basins were therefore used to collect the surplus water, and a canal system was constructed to distribute it as needed to the fields."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_economy_plan_your_irrigation_infrastructure"	"Basic irrigation systems were widespread in the ancient world because they were simple to maintain. Perennial irrigation was rarer, and required longer canal systems, a method of storage, and better maintenance to ensure that silt and salt build-up was kept in check. In Mesopotamia, the river system was able to supply water to the surrounding arable land in the dry season through a system of canals, closed off by dykes and sluice gates. Water was stored in reservoirs, either natural or man-made, and then lifted into the irrigation channels. While this was a labour-intensive task, the results of such toil were remarkable and hugely beneficial to harvests in the area."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_economy_reclaim_your_desert"	"Agriculture in desert regions was chiefly hampered by the general lack of water due to low precipitation and lack of rivers or lakes. To overcome this problem, the inhabitants of arid areas developed the qanat system which involved sloping underground tunnels that transported water to arable land plots. In river regions dams could be constructed to ensure proper irrigation at all times. A famous one was built in the 3rd century, during the rule of Sasanian Emperor Shapur I by captured Roman soldiers. Known as Band e-Kaisar or Caesar’s dam, it made the nearby city of Shushtar into a prominent agricultural centre for centuries to come."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_economy_tax_your_nobility"	"The Sassanids inherited the Parthian satrapy system, whereby major noble families were empowered to guard the integrity of the state both in terms of the economy and the armed forces. The new ruling dynasty, however, desired to have as much direct power over matters as possible, which led to the establishment of royal cities, built at the order of the Sassanid ruler and bearing his name. After its founding, such a city served as a military base and eventually grew into a regional administrative centre. Royal cities were governed by a representative of the Shahanshah with the title of 'Shahrab'. According to historical sources, Ardashir I, the first Sassanid ruler, established no less than eight royal cities during his reign. The creation of a royal city was a costly endeavour, and it is possible that the Shahanshah imposed additional taxes on noblemen and governors to secure the required funds."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_governance_claim_your_crown"	"The royal crown was as a symbol of the authority its owner held over his subjects. The Shahanshahs of the Sassanid dynasty wore crowns of great intricacy and variety. Instead of having a single crown that would be passed from predecessor to successor, every single ruler in the dynasty had a crown made specifically for him. The earliest members imitated the Parthian style of headgear, while in later centuries crowns had a more distinctive style that was less individualistic but more complex. It is even possible that apart from the personal preferences of the Shahanshah, the exact shape and details of the crown were governed by strict regulations."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_governance_compile_your_code_of_laws"	"The tenets of Sassanid legislation were rooted in Zoroastrianism, which taught that order and truth could only be achieved by observing the laws given by Ahura Mazda and overseen by Mithra. In practice, Zoroastrian priests held legal power and even the Shahanshah's will was declared secondary to divine decree. Non-Zoroastrian crown subjects were allowed to abide by the law of their own religion, with cases of capital crime being an exception to that rule. Additionally, different regions had local laws and legal practices named 'kardag'. Areas populated by migrating nomads may have adhered to the 'kardag' principle completely."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_governance_control_your_urban_development"	"The Sassanid Shahanshahs were known to be great builders and such fame was well deserved. Many of them not only established completely new cities but also improved existing ones. For example, the metropolis of Ctesiphon was greatly expanded during the Sassanid period as it served as a capital city where royal coronations took place. Its many suburbs gradually came to sprawl along both banks of the River Tigris and, in time, Ctesiphon came to resemble several cities close to one another rather than a unified whole. Among the more notable buildings were a magnificent palace (known as the 'White Palace'), a great fire temple and even a Christian church."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_governance_demand_zealous_labour"	"As populations boomed the demand for food increased, driving farmers to use more intensive farming techniques. Technology played its part, with improved tools and the domestication of large animals to pull advanced and effective ploughs. Larger labour forces and the growth of other techniques, such as terraced farming, opened new areas for cultivation. The construction of more complex canals and dams helped to turn arid landscapes into well-irrigated farming plots."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_governance_establish_vigorous_administration"	"After a period of civil war, the Sassanids overthrew the Parthians and in AD 224 Ardashir was crowned the first Sassanid ruler of Persia. In the following years, he proceeded to consolidate his power by quelling local rebellions and expanding his territory. As the dust settled, it was apparent that the new empire required a bureaucratic system of considerable complexity. Provincial governors, counsellors, judges, accountants, simple scribes – all these offices had to be held by people who were as diligent as they were loyal. Zoroastrian priests played a special and prominent role in the administrative hierarchy too, as evidenced by discovered seals dating from Sassanid times."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_governance_extend_peasant_class_rights"	"Composed of diverse cultures, eastern states contained many different forms of social hierarchy. Those following Alexander the Great's empire, such as the Seleucids, usually maintained the Hellenic traditions of their predecessors and a great deal of Greek culture besides. Over time, the native nobility adopted these ways as a means of advancement, creating a Hellenised elite. Underneath them were native people and an ever-increasing influx of colonists, all too busy trying to live to worry about much beyond their homes and food. In contrast, the great Parthian kings embraced their Persian heritage, reviving many of their traditions."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_governance_glorify_illoustrous_lineage"	"The ruler of Sassanid Persia bore the title of Shahanshah or 'King of Kings' for a reason. He held all the authority in his hands and every person in the realm must obey his will. However, it was not enough to simply hold authority – much like a garden, it had to be expanded and improved in every possible way. One such way was to claim that the Sassanids were descended from Achaemenid dynasty which had ruled Persia from the middle of the 6th century BC to 330 BC, when it was destroyed by Alexander the Great."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_governance_promote_your_trusted_councillors"	"The power of the Shahanshah was almost absolute. However, his opponents (often members of his own family) often conspired to reduce his influence or even forcibly dethrone him. As the latter option involved death, it was extremely important for the Shahanshah to choose whom he could trust and who to shun. Once a close circle of 'friends' was established, they could be empowered to further the will of their lord. As you might expect, the Shahanshah sometimes tested that allegiance to ensure his friends were still loyal."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_governance_shahanshah_irean_ud_aneran"	"At its largest point, Persia extended from India to the East to Egypt and Thrace to the west. It was the dream of every worthy Sassanid ruler to surpass that glorious achievement through diplomatic might or the indomitable onslaught of conquest. The chief obstacle in the way was the mighty Roman Empire. Sooner or later it would have to be toppled, the Legions routed, and its cities reduced to ruin. Once this was done, all people of the world would be allowed to serve the one Shahanshah and show their gratitude for his benevolent rule."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_civil_top_oversee_trade"	"When Hormizd assumed the position of Sassanid Shahanshah, he had to live up to his subjects' expectations. His father, Shapur, had led a series of successful wars against Rome and even managed to capture Emperor Valerian. At the same time, his rule was an era of architectural advancement and religious tolerance. As Hormizd aimed at eclipsing the accomplishments of his predecessor, a prudent first step was to improve the economic ties that bound his satraps to the crown's authority."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_battle_motivate_your_hirelings"	"Subsistence in small settlements became increasingly harder as the Roman Empire fell into crisis. Many villages were left defenceless and had to fend for themselves. Bandits, pirates and rogue military regiments were a common occurrence, some of them forming large companies and becoming strong enough to be recognised as a threat to smaller states. With the proper 'encouragement', they could be persuaded to fight as mercenaries, supporting the military effort of the highest bidder – the right amount of gold can make a band of raiders fight with impressive fervour."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_battle_order_additional_pack_camels"	"The archer was a maligned figure within the ranks of the Greek and Roman armies: yet, as ancient warfare evolved, the need for them increased. The nomadic hordes of the east specialised in fast-moving bow cavalry and these skilled riders soon became coveted mercenaries. The need to keep these archers supplied with ample ammunition was a vital logistic requirement for the armies of the east. During the Battle of Carrhae, the Parthian general Surena used camels to supply arrows to his horse archers, allowing them to play a key role in Parthia’s victory."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_battle_praise_your_outriders"	"Cavalry was the major strength of the Sassanid army. To achieve victory in his wars, the Shahanshah relied on heavily armoured cataphracts and clibanarii to charge at the enemies and disperse them. Sometimes enemies were brave enough to retain their formation in the face of the oncoming hooved-tide of death and, in such cases, swift horse archers unleashed volleys of arrows to soften up stubborn foes. These mounted bowmen usually wielded composite bows that gave them the ability to shoot in any direction while on horseback. An arrow fired from such a bow flew with such force that it could pierce straight through the shield of a Roman Legionary."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_battle_refine_your_naval_artillery"	"The Hellenistic world was at the forefront of construction when it came to huge war galleys bristling with artillery. Alexander the Great used catapults from his ships when he besieged Tyre in 332 BC, and it was the Greeks who built the most formidable floating fortress of the time, the 'Syracusia'. Designed by inventor Archimedes, this huge transport vessel was said to be 55 metres in length. It featured a raised fighting deck that housed a giant catapult capable of switching between firing a five metre dart or a 80 kilogramme stone missile."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_battle_rekindle_old_rivalry"	"The Sassanid Empire was more than a match for the power of Rome. Built on the ruins of Parthia, Sassanid rulers remembered well the Parthian victory at Carrhae against the Legions of Crassus in 53 BC, and aimed to repeat that success. The new dynasty was a well-oiled military machine, adept in siege warfare, concentrated around the venerated, almost godly, figure of the Shahanshah. As the Roman Empire was gripped in the coil of civil war, the Sassanids pushed from the east. After a series of battles, in AD 260 the Roman Emperor Valerian was captured alive in Edessa and perished in captivity - the first Emperor to suffer this fate. The Sassanid state outlived the Western Roman Empire and kept fighting against the Eastern Roman Empire until the middle of the 7th century AD, when it was overrun by Muslim conquerors."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_battle_research_your_machines_of_war"	"For centuries the Roman Empire was unrivalled in the art of siege warfare. Even larger states such as Parthian Persia were not up to par with the Imperial engineers. The Sassanid dynasty, however, brought about a reformed military that was sufficiently capable of conducting sieges. For example, the Siege of Amida in AD 359 shows the Persians assaulting Roman fortifications with iron-clad siege towers and under the artillery support of 'scorpions'. A century before that battle, at the dawn of their rule, the Sassanids conquered the town of Dura Europos by trying to undermine its walls – one of the earliest examples of sapping and tunnel warfare."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_battle_reward_your_kataphractoi"	"The term 'kataphractoi' is of Greek origin and can be interpreted as 'fully-armoured' or 'closed from all sides'. In military terms, it described heavily-armoured cavalrymen. These shock troops were first fielded as part of Darius’ army at Gaugalema in 352 BC. Mostly Bactrian and Scythian horsemen, these riders and their mounts required excellent stamina as they were completely enclosed by metal scale armour, and in desert heat too! Cataphract cavalry could use their weight and armour to penetrate an enemy line, but were far less agile than regular horsemen."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_battle_summon_your_immortals"	"The feared Immortals were an elite infantry unit of the Achaemenid Empire. According to Herodotus, there were always exactly 10,000 of them and were so named since whenever a member of the unit was killed, wounded or in any other way unable to serve, he was instantly replaced by a new soldier. The Sassanids revived this ancient Persian tradition by creating an elite force named 'Zhayedan' or 'Immortals'. Unlike the Immortals of old, the Zhayedan were a cavalry unit. Trained to be the best of the best, Sassanid commanders usually kept their Zhayedan horsemen in reserve, unleashing them at crucial moments to devastating effect."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_battle_teach_sailors_fight"	"By the 5th century BC naval battles were changing, as the ship’s ram became the principle weapon, making artful seamanship and carefully timed manoeuvres the key to success. There were a range of recognised tactics, including the 'periplous' – an outflanking manoeuvre – and the 'diekplous', a more complex movement which was also known as 'breaking the line'. Here an attacking ship would navigate between two enemy vessels and rely on superior speed and agility to ram the midships or stern of its target. This tactic could be aided by sailing close enough to the enemy to shear off their oars, immobilising them before ramming."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_campaign_conquer_the_sands"	"When the last Parthian ruler fell, the Sassanid dynasty extended its reign over Persian lands and turned to conquest. Persian armies were used to fighting in the harsh desert sands and their experience proved to be invaluable during the upcoming campaigns whereby the Sassanid Empire expanded towards Bactria, western Kushan, Mesopotamia and even the city of Antioch on the Mediterranean shore. Rome struggled to hold the Persian war machine back, only achieving victory at Anatolia with the help of Palmyra's ruler, Odaenathus. The lands of Syria and Arabia remained within reach and could be a stepping stone towards conquest of African sands or the rivers of Asia and beyond - the image of an empire fit for a true Shahanshah loomed closer and closer."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_campaign_employ_mardomard_champions"	"In ancient times, a battle was often prefaced by a duel between champions from the opposing sides. In the Sassanid Empire, the challenge to single combat was known as 'mard o-mard' and members of the elite fighting units were trained in all intricacies of this personal battle style. A duel and its outcome had a special ceremonial meaning for the Persians. According to sources, the peace treaty between Sassanids and Romans from AD 421 was signed after a Persian champion perished in a mounted bout against a Gothic warrior in service of Rome."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_campaign_enforce_conscription"	"The real strength of the Sassanid army was, primarily, heavy cavalry and seasoned skirmish troops. The Savaran cavalry were led by the 'great' families of noble Persian and Parthian blood. This mounted corps was also often reinforced by mercenaries. Infantry, by contrast, were not usually held in much regard, with some even referring to the levied Paighan – from which the vast majority of Sassanid infantrymen were drawn – as 'a crowd of pitiable peasants'. These poor quality levies were raised by the aristocracy, conscripted from the lands they owned to act, in most cases, as little more than ‘meat shields’ for the Sassanid advance. This social aristocracy bled quite clearly into the military, and remained as the basis for all military recruitment and conscription until the reforms of Khosrow I, who altered the system so that lesser nobility, primarily farmers and land-owners, could be drawn into the army. This dramatically reduced the aristocracy's power, as the armour and weaponry was provided by the state, meaning the newer forces swore loyalty to the Shahanshah himself, and not his local feudal lords."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_campaign_enforce_voluntary_service"	"Among the elite soldiers in the Sassanid infantry were its archers, trained to deliver rapid volleys of arrows from behind large walls of wicker shields. Those shields were manned by the unimpressive Sassanian foot soldiers – a conscription force, recruited from the peasant population. They are described as pitiful troops of little fighting ability, despised by the veteran Persian warriors whom they served. Since these peasant troops were present in such high numbers, they often had to arm themselves with agricultural tools such as pitchforks, axes and sickles. These levies had the lowest morale in the Sassanid military and would often cluster together for protection during an engagement. They were not a threat to any regular army, but their purpose was to be an obstacle, a human shield before the cavalry and archer regiments."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_campaign_hasten_your_military_expanse"	"An army can live off the land in most places, although deserts are an obvious exception. What can’t be found, stolen or made on the march, however, must be carried with it: arrows, spears, spare armour and weapons by the ox-cart load, medical supplies, decent wine from home, and the hundred other little things that make campaigning bearable as opposed to just plain miserable. Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars. It is pointless taking a soldier to a battlefield if he is hungry, thirsty, ill or exhausted. He will not give his best in such circumstances, no matter how inspiring the leadership qualities of his commanders."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_campaign_hire_nisean_breeders"	"Nisean horses were famed for their speed and beauty, making them the most sought after and expensive steeds in the ancient world. The Persians held them as sacred and limited their use to the nobility; two grey Nisean stallions pulled the royal chariot. They became so sought after that the Greeks imported them to breed with their own native horses and when Alexander conquered Persia he demanded a tribute of Nisean horses from the cities he captured."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_campaign_improve_your_mercenary_administration"	"Mercenaries have existed for thousands of years but the earliest written record of them dates back to the 7th century BC, when Greek hoplites sought employment as bodyguards serving Pharaohs and Greek tyrants alike. Mercenaries became a great way to bolster troop numbers during times of war, something to which the Carthaginians resorted during their war with Rome. They exploited their trade links to recruit troops from the Iberian peninsula and the Balearic islands. The Romans were more sparing with their use of mercenaries, but acknowledged the shortcomings within the Legion, notably archers and cavalry, by making up for the lack with carefully chosen mercenary troops."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_campaign_optimize_your_shahrab_system"	"During the times when the east was dominated by Parthia, kings drew their power from noble families, who supplied soldiers and tribute, resulting in city-states that mostly governed themselves. The Sassanid dynasty established a different, more centralised order. The Shahanshah established the so called 'royal cities', which served as the seats of officially appointed governors, known as 'Shahrab', who were in charge of managing these semi-independent regions, both urban towns and rural areas. The Shahrabs also maintained garrisons in order to enforce Sassanid rule, protecting settlements from invaders and looking after public order."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_campaign_starve_your_enemies"	"As populations grew and the demand for food increased, long-term storage of grain became vital. With improved transport allowing for the movement of grain, it became possible to construct vast storage warehouses to hold shipped-in food stock. The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population, but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or 'horrea' were built along the embankment of the River Tiber, in an area known as the Emporium district."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_recruitment_emphasize_on_your_cavalry"	"The Sassanid army, being heirs to the Parthian military tradition, emphasised its cavalry forces. Its infantry units usually played a support role and were of various levels of training and armament. Spearmen and bowmen were often mixed together and sometimes accompanied cavalry in battle, harassing the enemy with projectiles as the horsemen moved in for the charge. Often, during a march, the army gradually increased in size, as soldiers were recruited from territories loyal to the Shahanshah. Specific peoples of the Sassanid Empire were known to be particularly militaristic and produced excellent foot warriors; such a people were the Daylamites, whose high quality troops gained them a sort of semi-independence."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_recruitment_exact_your_levies"	"Sassanid soldiers were recruited from various sources. At the bottom were the units of light infantry, poorly equipped and lacking in training. Then there were the more quality troops provided by landowners, governors or allied nations. The majority of the horse archers comprised of petty nobles and sometimes nomad mercenaries. The ranks of elite heavy horsemen, however, were filled by members of important noble clans and families – those who could afford steeds and equipment and the time to train in their use."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_recruitment_expand_tactical_exercises"	"As armies adopted flexible forces, subdivided into units, each with their individual function and strengths, tactical drills became the difference between victory and defeat. Layered tactical manoeuvres could be planned and executed to counter any enemy and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202BC. Here the Romans effortlessly moved as one to create open lanes in their formation, allowing the rampaging beasts to charge harmlessly through their ranks."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_recruitment_improve_your_harbour_infrastructure"	"Aside from the wealth generated by the Silk Road, the Sassanids relied heavily on sea trade routes that brought commodities from India or Egypt. Their merchant fleets required ports of suitable size, where safe mooring was prepared for each vessel so that its goods could be easily unloaded and sent to stores or markets. It is quite probable that the Shahanshah personally oversaw the development of the larger ports and would make sure that a portion of the harbour space was dedicated to military ships – after all, trade routes always needed protection from pirate raids."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_recruitment_initiate_your_naval_dominance"	"All warships in the ancient world were limited in size by a number of practical considerations. This meant most were 'triremes' or 'threes', or perhaps 'quinqueremes' or 'fives', usually named for the number of banks of oars or the number of rowers. Being propelled by oars had limits: there were only so many rowers that could operate a single oar; there was a practical limit to the stroke and angle of an oar; and so forth. There was also a limit to how long and slender a galley could be before it would flex too much in any kind of sea and tear itself to pieces, but too broad a beam would make it a lumbering target. None of these constraints mattered to some nations, who built increasingly large vessels, culminating in a few '30s' and even a couple of '40s'. These gargantuan vessels must have been catamarans with fighting platforms linking the hulls, but they were all little more than vanity projects for the kings and Pharaohs who ordered their construction."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_recruitment_intensify_physical_conditioning"	"In Sparta, baby boys were examined by its elders at birth. Those considered too weak were cast from Mount Taygetos, but the worthy faced a childhood designed to condition them for the physical demands of war. The 'agoge' training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and universally feared fighting force. If a boy survived to the age of thirteen he was subjected to a further seven years of formal military training until finally, aged twenty, he would be considered to have reached manhood, ready to become a true warrior of Sparta. This 'Gold Standard' set by the Spartans reverberated down the centuries, as successive powers trained elite forces as shock troops that could turn the tide of battle when deployed at the right moment."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_recruitment_practice_your_strategic_maneouvres"	"While battles were traditionally fought on vast, open landscapes, there were exceptions and a clever strategist could use these to his advantage. Terrain was an effective form of defence, with high ground, woods and forests used to protect the rear and flanks of an army, particularly when faced with a cavalry-heavy opponent. Such features also offered cover for ambush attacks, and knowledge of their terrain became a key factor in the success of the Germans and Gauls who used guerrilla tactics to counter the organised ranks of the Roman army."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_recruitment_reorganize_your_military_hierarchy"	"Based on the Achaemenid military tradition, the Sassanid army had a sophisticated hierarchy. At the top of all armed forces was the 'Eran Spahbod' or 'Supreme Commander' – a nobleman that led and coordinated all military effort. The title of field general was 'Spahbod', whose duty it was to command an entire army or a portion one in cooperation with another Spahbod. The commanders of smaller troop divisions had different titles according to their troop types. For example, a 'Paygan-Salar' was a commander of infantry, a 'Pushtigban-Salar' a commander of the royal guard, etc. Fortress garrison commanders were given the title of 'Argbed', which might also have meant 'tax collector'. The early-Sassanid navy was nothing special, but still it had its 'Eran Spahbod' equivalent: the 'Navbed'. In almost all cases, members of the top military layers belonged to powerful noble houses, most likely extremely loyal to the Shahanshah."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_recruitment_summon_your_shipbuilders"	"Ship construction in the ancient world developed in response to the perceived need for bigger, stronger vessels. Double planking allowed the ancient shipwrights to build vast, strong hulls whilst keeping their ships light and manoeuvrable. The technique used two types of wood, with the inner layer constructed from a softer material than the exterior. In some cases, a layer of lead was placed between the wood in vulnerable areas of the ship, while cloth or wool soaked in wax was also placed between the layers to waterproof them."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_sassanid_military_top_order_paygan_training"	"As the Sassanids relied heavily on the use of cavalry in battle, their infantry was eclipsed by the presence of magnificent clibanarii wings and squads of horse-archers. The bulk of the foot soldiers, termed 'paygan', were often conscripted from the peasantry. They were poorly armed, often carrying a nothing but a wickerwork shield and a spear or a bow. In battle, the paygan advanced steadily in close formation - mere  cannon fodder to occupy the attention of the enemy and thus give the cavalry the time required to take position for a charge. Outside of combat, the conscripted peasants acted as servants to members of more elite units and fulfilled guard duties, along with any other menial tasks that crossed their commanders' minds."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_civil_culture_adopt_new_ways"	"Saxoni boats sailed across the sea and reached foreign shores where plunder awaited in ample supply. Aside from this aspect, the expeditions caused the Saxoni to clash with the way people lived elsewhere. It goes without saying that on their way back, raiders brought many aspects of various overseas cultures - via personal impressions and memories or in the form of slaves who were free to retain their outlook on life and religion in their new homes."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_civil_culture_venerate_the_irminsul"	"The ancient Saxoni worshipped a deity named 'Irmin'. The name itself might have actually been a nickname of another god, possibly Wodanaz. Worship was related with massive pillars called 'Irminsul' that were raised in specific outdoor locations. While the exact purpose of these pillars is unclear, they might have symbolised the tree that bound the entire universe together. In this notion the Irminsul might be related to the later Norse concept of 'Yggdrasil' – the great ash tree that connects all Nine Worlds."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_civil_economy_expand_food_storages"	"Grain kilns were used to dry out grain before it could be stored, which was particularly important in the damp climates of Britain and Ireland. The kilns consisted of a sunken pit which was then covered over using a wide variety of materials that included sods, wood, and in some cases, stone. A peat fire would then heat the kernels, causing them to harden; this allowed the tribes to store more grain for longer periods of time and was especially useful through the harsh, cold winters."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_civil_economy_expand_harbours"	"The Saxoni were adept sailors and raiders whose bravery bordered on recklessness. They knew that no seaborne raiding expedition could be counted as successful until the plunder was delivered to friendly ports to be divided up between the participants. The ports in question were established at convenient locations sheltered from sea storms. However, once a port was founded, its facilities needed maintenance and development. While some ports were possibly autonomous and maintained by local boat crews, others might have been under the direct control of the king or overseen by nobles who answered to him."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_civil_economy_explore_trade_routes"	"A lodestone was a navigational device created using a naturally magnetised metal, 'magnetite'. When suspended, the stone would be drawn towards the earth’s magnetic pole and spin to face north. Geologists are still unsure exactly how they became magnetised, but it is widely attributed to the strong magnetic fields that surround lightning bolts. This theory is supported by the fact that magnetite tends to be found close to the earth’s surface."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_civil_top_adopt_way_of_sea"	"'Litus Saxonicum', also known as the 'Saxon Shore', was a series of fortifications built by the Romans on the shores of Britannia, Belgica and Lugdunensis. Around AD 280, many Saxoni and Frankish raiding parties took to the sea in the hope of plundering Roman lands, with some tribes even intending to settle along the Atlantic coast. As the fortifications were arranged in a long chain along the coast, the journey  to locations ripe for looting took a long time, forcing raiders to fish for food in order to live. This led to skilled fishermen gaining a higher status among their warbands – their spears were useful both for fishing and fighting Roman defenders."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_military_battle_brave_the_waves"	"Coastal settlements were a common sight in the Roman Empire. Maritime trade, fishing and shipbuilding were a simple way to support a city's subsistence. Many Roman veterans also chose to spend their retirement in villas close to the sea. This made shoreline towns richer, but also a more desirable target for raiding and pillaging. The Saxoni, in particular, took to the sea when looking to plunder. They sailed on longboats towards the wealthier villages and took by force everything they had. The Roman navy was in theory capable of defending, but their administration and command reacted slowly to surprise raids. Often, by the time Roman ships came to aid a beleaguered settlement, the raiders had already sailed away."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_military_battle_seek_out_rich_settlements"	"A Germanic noble's main source of wealth was warfare, which allowed him to keep a large retinue. Military success and bountiful raids gave prestige to a leader in a society where all free men were warriors. Riches came to a noble quickly after victories, but a defeat made him disappear even more quickly, and defeat was very likely in the event of an organised Roman punitive expedition. These expeditions deployed scouting parties, a practice which wise Germanic nobles adapted for their own purpose. Using scouts to find rich, easy targets for a raid ensured that the noble wouldn't lose his wealth and retinue, but instead add to them."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_military_campaign_copy_roman_ships_construction"	"The chief weapon of barbarian boat crews was their courage and the tendency to disregard both their personal safety and that of their ship in the pursuit of plunder and glory. However, this approach did little to make up for their relatively poor vessels, which were fit only for sailing along coastal areas and down rivers. A Roman fleet could be defeated by seaborne barbarians only if they managed to catch it moored in its harbour. After subduing the harbour's defenders, the barbarians were then free to examine the captured Roman vessels and perhaps even learn a thing or two about civilised shipbuilding techniques."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_military_campaign_scourge_the_seas"	"During the dark times that the Roman Empire faced in the 3rd century AD, barbarians seized the opportunity to raid unprotected settlements in Rome's outer provinces. In the area around the Danube, Germanic tribes looted many small towns and villages, before the Legions fought them off and drove them back across the great river. However, Roman soldiers were used to fighting on land and naval invasions were more difficult to predict and prevent. The seafaring Saxoni took advantage of this, raiding many settlements on the coasts of Britannia and Belgica, then escaping back to the sea. Rome's reaction was to create numerous coastal hillforts to defend what was left of the ravaged towns, creating what is now known as the 'Saxon Shore' defences."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_3c_saxoni_military_top_employ_master_shipbuilders"	"Roman shipbuilding was based on centuries long Carthaginian and Greek traditions, enriched by Roman ambition and ingenuity. Unlike them, the barbarians relied on their own carpenters and sailors to build boats. The tribes had no recorded history, therefore an older builder taught the required skills to a young apprentice as the only way to preserve the knowledge for future generations. It is easy to imagine that this method was too primitive for significant general advancements to be achieved. Still, during his lifetime, a barbarian could become a master boat builder and thus be invaluable to his tribal chieftain."	"True"

Over 5,600 artillery balls have been found within the site of Carthage; they predate the Roman attack on the city that burnt it to the ground in 146BC."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_military_tactics_strategic_manoeuvres"	"While battles were traditionally fought on vast, open landscapes, there were exceptions and a clever strategist could use these to his advantage. Terrain was an effective form of defence, with high ground, woods and forests used to protect the rear and flanks of an army, particularly when faced with a cavalry-heavy opponent. Such features also offered cover for ambush attacks, and knowledge of their terrain became a key factor in the success of the Germans and Gauls who used guerrilla tactics to counter the organised ranks of the Roman army."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_kush_civil_economy_tribal_vassalage"	"Trade with foreign nations and tribes was vital to the Egyptians. It allowed them to gain access to goods and resources which their lands were unable to produce. Some of these resources could be gathered through tribute paid to Pharaoh from the regions surrounding Egypt. While not under direct government control, the vassal tribes in these regions were influenced by Egyptian rule and culture and were obliged to honour Pharaoh with regular gifts. These were then presented as rewards to officials, helping to distribute them through the entire Egyptian economy."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_dk_nab_civil_construction_moulded_architecture"	"By perfecting concrete, a plentiful and cheap building material, the Romans were able to build structures quickly and without the need for vast teams of skilled craftsmen. Timber frames, or moulds, were used to provide a framework for the concrete walls; constructing them was a task that could be done by a relatively unskilled labourer. The frameworks could also be re-used, making the whole process relatively cheap, quick and efficient. This could prove vital in times of war when defensive structures needed to be built quickly."

However, these were heavy and cumbersome machines, requiring large operating crews. Loading and firing took time and left the crew members vulnerable to enemy attacks, particularly from fast-moving cavalry. Placing other units nearby to guard the crew members went some way to protecting them, but arming them and improving their personal armour allowed them to protect themselves."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_ara_civil_philosophy_philosophers"	"The great Greek philosophers Socrates, Plato and Aristotle shaped what we define as modern-day philosophy. By questioning the firmly-held belief that the gods were responsible for everything, and suggesting more rational explanations for day-to-day events instead, the philosophers had a profound effect on society. Not surprisingly these new ideas were not welcomed by all, and some philosophers were persecuted for their corrupting influence. Socrates was sentenced to death by an Athenian jury, but his work inspired Plato who went on to create a school of thought that changed governmental practices and addressed the welfare of society."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_kush_military_top_ways_of_apedemak"	"Apedemak was the Nubian god of war. Throughout Nubian history, its warriors desired their patron god's strength and ferocity in combat. In one hymn, Apedemak is described as "One who sends forth a flaming breath against his enemies in this his name, Great of Power, who slays the rebels with (his) strength". The god was generally depicted wearing battle-dress of leather armour and carrying weapons, usually  a bow and arrows. He was also shown slaying enemies or holding onto bound captives, who were restrained with cords around their necks."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_economy_intensified_agriculture"	"As populations boomed the demand for food increased, driving farmers to use more intensive farming techniques. Technology played its part, with improved tools and the domestication of large animals to pull advanced and effective ploughs. Larger labour forces and the growth of other techniques, such as terraced farming, opened new areas for cultivation. The construction of more complex canals and dams helped to turn arid landscapes into well-irrigated farming plots."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_top_social_organisation"	"Composed of diverse cultures, eastern states contained many different forms of social hierarchy. Those following Alexander the Great's empire, such as the Seleucids, usually followed their Hellenic traditions and maintained a great deal of Greek culture. Over time, the native nobility would adopt these ways, often as a means of advancement, creating a Hellenised elite. Underneath them were native peoples and an ever-increasing influx of colonists, all too busy trying to live to worry about much beyond their homes and food. In contrast, the great Parthian kings embraced their Persian heritage, reviving many of their traditions."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_num_civil_philosophy_religious_conformity"	"Like many civilisations, the Carthaginians believed in a pantheon of gods and goddesses. Chief amongst the gods were the God Ba’al Hammon and the Goddess Tanit. If we are to believe writers of the time these deities demanded regular child sacrifices: nothing else could slake their dark appetites and guarantee their favour to the people of Carthage. Nobles were expected to offer their own children to satisfy the hunger of Ba’al Hammon and Tanit. Anything less would be have been an affront to the gods."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_construction_tax_labour"	"Taxation becomes futile when a populace are too poor to pay taxes. At such times in the ancient world, the poor were forced to work unpaid to help complete civil projects. Such measures were common practice at the time; in Egypt the Pharaoh would be merciless in the taxation of his subjects. Peasants were expected to work several days a month to help maintain roads and canals and to lend their muscle to construction and mining. Some governments could be strict in the extreme when imposing tax labour: in Babylonia, failure to fulfil labour obligations would see a man forfeit his lands."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_construction_crane"	"The Romans adopted the principle of the crane from the Greeks and modified its design to create apparatus capable of lifting huge weights. Some of Rome’s most magnificent buildings undoubtedly benefitted from the use of cranes. The Pantheon, for example, has sections which weigh up to nine tonnes each and had to be lifted over nine metres. It is thought that the Romans used two types of crane. The first, the 'polyspastos', had a jib built from two timber beams in an inverted v-shape; the thickness and length of these beams would determine the weight the crane could carry. The second crane type, the 'rispastos', used a single beam jib and could be swung sideways but was not able to bear heavy loads."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_dk_nab_civil_philosophy_military_mint"	"Carthage relied heavily on mercenaries to bolster its citizen armies, a strategy that worked well for short campaigns close to home. However, when campaigns lasted longer than anticipated and coin was not forthcoming, mercenaries became less than trustworthy. In 240BC a group of mercenaries who had fought for Carthage during the First Punic War seized Tunis because they weren't paid. To help prevent this situation from ever arising again the Carthaginians began minting coins on campaign. They were made from silver, gold and electrum and were marked “from the camp”."	"True"

However, an army’s movement could be severely hampered by its supply train. It was the Greeks who revolutionised military supply and logistics; they disbanded the legion of attendants and wives that trailed behind every army, and introduced the speedier horse and mule to replace the ox-drawn carts, meaning that the soldiers had to carry more. The creation of standardised coinage also allowed states to provide for their armies in enemy territory; as their money could be trusted anywhere, local merchants gradually evolved into the first military contractors."

"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_construction_measuring_instruments"	"Instruments to measure distance and the slope of the land helped to develop the ancient art and profession of land surveying. It is widely believed that the Egyptians were the first to invent such instruments, although one of the most influential tools, the 'groma', is said to have come from Mesopotamia. This tool was simple in appearance: a two-metre staff supported a crossed bracket, with a plumb bob hanging from each of the four cross points.

With many of the ruling elite Hellenistic in origin, it was common practice to mix both Greek and local customs in religious observances. Rather than enforcing their own view, rulers commonly allowed their people and any immigrant settlers to continue their own religious practices.

Annual floods renewed the soil’s fertility and the irrigated the surrounding land. By creating a series of man-made water works, they could harness the life-giving powers of the Nile still further. Canals helped to form lakes which could be used as reservoirs to provide year-round irrigation.

Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars.

This is because from the age of the pharaohs right up to medieval times, Nubians were famed for their extraordinary archery skills, both when fighting on foot or mounted. Archers formed the core of the Nubian armies which conquered Egypt in the 8th century BC, and confronted the troops of the Assyrian empire. The skill of Nubian archers made them valued parts of foreign armies also; Egyptian texts from as early as 2400BC note the presence of Nubians in Egyptian armies. Under the Kushite queen Amanirenas, Nubian archers defeated a Roman force and, after five years of war, a peace that favoured the Kushites was agreed in 20BC."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_philosophy_cultism"	"The idea of the 'Imperial Cult', for the worship of Rome in the form of a Roman Emperor, started when Julius Caesar was officially given divine status by the Senate. His adopted son, Augustus, then went on to give himself the title of 'Pontifex Maximus', chief priest of the Roman state, and encouraged the construction of temples in his name. The reverence of a living Emperor was not practised in Rome itself, but throughout the rest of the Empire citizens had an obligation not only to serve the Emperor but also to swear allegiance to him as a figure of worship. This allowed Rome to unify their distant provinces and spread Roman culture."	"True"

In the case of the Seleucids, their centralised system eventually fragmented into separate kingdoms, like Armenia and Bactria.

Fore-and-aft rigging was the solution to that problem. In this system, the sail is set parallel to the keel of the vessel, rather than at right-angles. This allows greater manoeuvrability when facing into the wind. While fore-and-aft rigging did not become widespread until many centuries later, there is ample evidence to confirm that it was employed by ancient shipwrights with the 'sprit', the triangular lateen and the quadrilateral lateen all in use."	"True"

So great was their love for these beasts that stables were built within the city's walls, large enough to house 400 elephants. They favoured North African elephants, a species thought to be smaller than their Indian and sub-Saharan African cousins, and use of the breed eventually drove it to extinction.

There is also empirical evidence from Kush that shows the use of poison-tipped arrows. Warriors have been using bows to hunt and fight since before recorded history. Since at least early antiquity, arrows were dipped into poison to better (and more duplicitously) kill the enemy.

With improved transport allowing for the movement of grain, it became possible to construct vast storage warehouses to hold shipped-in food stock. The Romans had an influx of around half-a-million tonnes of food from their harvests which would eventually be dispersed around the city population but this was stored within huge warehouse complexes built at Ostia and just outside Rome. A vast network of warehouses or 'horrea' were built along the embankment of the River Tiber in an area known as the Emporium district."	"True"

Starvation is a constant threat: what food is within the walls is all that there will be until the siege is ended. Those who cannot fight must be made to leave, preferably before the siege begins. Food supplies then last longer. At the Battle of Alesia in 52BC the decision to expel women and children from the fortifications was made too late. Throwing out non-combatants meant more food for the fighters, but by this point the Romans would not allow refugees through their lines. The women and children starved in the no-man’s land between the two armies. Their agonies were watched, from the safety of the walls, by their own menfolk."	"True"

Logistics, the art of collecting all these supplies together and keeping them moving with the army, wins battles more reliably than military genius. Knowing where to march is the province of the strategist; getting everyone and everything there in time is logistics. Good generals know that supplies win wars.

Such was the importance of market location, and the routes taken by merchants and their caravans, that central government often made it their business to control them. By dictating preferred routes, governments could exert some control on who gained from the prosperity that booming trade brought.

"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_economy_formal_government"	"Eastern kingdoms, such as the Seleucids and Parthians, relied on a formalised structure of government to administer their territories. This was modelled on the system of the Achaemenid Empire, conquered by Alexander the Great, with Persian concepts continuing to be used. In the case of the Seleucids, their centralised system eventually fragmented into separate kingdoms, like Armenia and Bactria. In contrast, the decentralised government of the Parthian Empire, in which many kingdoms paid tribute to a 'King of Kings', fared better until its replacement by the Sassanid Empire in AD224."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_military_tactics_tactical_drills"	"As armies adopted flexible forces, subdivided into units, each with their individual function and strengths, tactical drills became the difference between victory and defeat. Layered tactical manoeuvres could be planned and executed to counter any enemy and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202BC. Here the Romans effortlessly moved as one to create open lanes in their formation, allowing the rampaging beasts to charge harmlessly through their ranks."	"True"

Those considered too weak were cast from Mount Taygetos, but the worthy faced a childhood designed to condition them for the physical demands of war. The 'agoge' training program was the most demanding in the ancient world and bred a hugely efficient and universally feared fighting force. If a boy survived to the age of thirteen he was subjected to a further seven years of formal military training until finally, aged twenty, he would be considered to have reached manhood, ready to become a true warrior of Sparta."	"True"

They survived so long because of their ingenuity, examples of which still survive to this day. Life in the desert necessitated the mastery of camels for both civil and military applications. It also required a reliance on a more fluid, hit-and-run style of fighting than the vast, flat plains found elsewhere. Men from the desert fought swiftly, from the saddle, striking and vanishing again before the enemy had a chance to engage."	"True"

Fore-and-aft rigging was the solution to that problem. In this system, the sail is set parallel to the keel of the vessel, rather than at right-angles. This allows greater manoeuvrability when facing into the wind. While fore-and-aft rigging did not become widespread until many centuries later, there is ample evidence to confirm that it was employed by ancient shipwrights with the 'sprit', the triangular lateen and the quadrilateral lateen all in use."

In their votive art, their gods and rulers are often depicted with bows or archers’ thumb rings, and their warriors were often buried with bows, quivers, arrows and rings. The shaped metal rings guarded archers’ fingers, allowing them to fully draw their powerful bows. Several types of bow were employed, including both the longbow and composite bow, which eventually revolutionised archery across Europe."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_ara_military_management_naval_artillery_training"	"Traditionally, artillery in naval warfare was restricted to the use of javelins, slings and archers. It was the Syracusans who made the first steps towards creating artillery pieces that could be used at sea. They designed a contraption known as the 'gastraphetes' or 'belly bow'. This oversized composite bow rested on the stomach of its user and was pulled back when braced by his feet. It could fire a substantial bolt some fifty yards further than a regular bow. This technology was then scaled up to form the basis of the early 'scorpion', which eventually evolved into an array of torsion-powered artillery pieces that became commonplace on the decks of ancient ships."

"technologies_long_description_dk_saba_civil_economy_annual_survey"	"The written word played a vital part in the administration of Egyptian lands, not least as a tool of taxation. An annual census gave the government a chance to survey the nation, and collect the information required to ensure that taxes could be levied effectively. Despite a population of over three million, the census found and recorded everyone from the poorest farmer to the richest landowner. Nobody could hide from the New Kingdom’s bureaucratic reach as the census, administered by a vast system of overseers and scribes, measured Egypt’s financial growth and prosperity."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_num_military_tactics_weapon_proficiency"	"Each army had its own training methods. Nations with hoplite-heavy armies believed dancing and athletics were sufficient to prepare a man for battle. Roman generals took a slightly different view. Legionaries trained with a wooden sword, twice the weight of a battle weapon, against a wooden post. They would train for hours, practising stabs, thrusts and feints against their immobile opponents. This would then progress to fencing practice with other recruits, using swords with covered tips, before the finely-honed weapon skills were taken into full mock battles."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_economy_crop_rotation"	"Planting the same crop on the same plot of land can gradually strip the soil of its nutrients, weakening the plant and inviting pests. Ancient farmers found that by carefully managing a plot these effects would subside, the soil would recover its fertility, and the crop would strengthen with each passing year. Various methodologies were practiced, including two, three and even four cycles of planting, with climate dictating the complexity of rotation and the crops that could be grown. One of the most popular techniques was the 'food, feed, fallow' system. This saw farmers divide fields into three sections and in each, start with a wheat crop, followed by a vegetable or cereal for livestock feed, and finally the land would for a time be left 'fallow', or unused, to replenish its nutrients."

"technologies_long_description_dk_saba_civil_economy_qanat"	"The qanat was an underground irrigation system, used in dry, mountainous regions as a method of transporting water over long distances for agricultural use. Evaporation was kept to a minimum, and the systems used groundwater, a more reliable source than seasonal rivers. A horizontal tunnel was dug, by hand, into a cliff or mountainside. Vertical shafts were then cut into it to allow ventilation and easy access to keep the main tunnel clean. Cleaning was a task often carried out by children who were lowered down through the vertical shafts on ropes and buckets."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_saba_military_management_military_method"	"Eastern armies, such as those of the Seleucid and Parthian Empires, were characterised by a mix of troops recruited from both east and west. In addition to their native conscripts, they consisted of many vassal and mercenary units. In Seleucid territories, these were used to support the limited numbers of immigrant Greek settlers that formed the mainstay of pike-armed phalanxes. Providing light infantry and cavalry, mercenaries and vassals would usually be employed to bolster the flanks. Thracian mercenaries were highly valued for their ability to fight and manoeuvre in difficult and even mountainous terrain."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_num_military_management_training_reforms"	"With the Marian Reforms, joining the Roman army became a full-time occupation. Men trained all year round, not just during the campaign season when Rome was under threat. Legionaries were expected to be able to fight in a number of formations with a variety of weapons. These skills were then tested in mock training battles. The captured Jewish leader, Josephus, witnessed such drills and offered a vivid account of the violence that took place “...it would be fair enough to call their drills bloodless battles and their battles bloody drills”."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_num_military_management_cavalry_tactics"	"Although Roman writers often refused to acknowledge the skills possessed by the barbarians, there was one area of warfare which they freely admitted the Celts excelled at: horsemanship. The Greek historian Strabo stated that the finest cavalrymen in the whole Roman army were Celts; they were incredibly versatile troops, able to ride to any area they were needed and dismount to fight on foot. This was made easier by the cleverly-designed bridles worn by their horses, which had a small peg for staking into the ground to keep the horse in place while its rider fought."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_construction_monumental_architecture"	"Advancing architectural techniques, together with improved transport, removed some limits on monumental building works. With organised mass labour, monuments could be constructed on a vast scale. Egyptian tombs and pyramids are some of the earliest examples of monumental architecture in the ancient world. The Greeks built magnificent temples, triumphal arches and monumental columns, as did the Romans. Such monuments were often erected to honour deities or victorious leaders. In conquered lands, they were an effective way of overawing the subject population and reminding them of their loyalties."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_nab_civil_construction_dioptra"	"The dioptra was first used by the Greek astronomers to fix the position of the stars. However, when this was superseded by a more accurate device, the armillary sphere, it found a new function as a surveying tool. It was a portable instrument that could be used to measure distances, angular measurements or work as a level. The dioptra could assess both the horizontal and vertical planes, allowing for readings of the deviation between two set locations, so offering accurate measurement of any angles involved."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_ara_civil_philosophy_scholarship"	"The ancient scholars questioned the world around them and gradually began forming disciplines such as astronomy, geography, mathematics, medicine and philosophy to define their discoveries. Some of these early scholars went on to become the greatest thinkers of their day, forming schools to pass on their knowledge to others.

"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_military_management_professional_soldiery"	"Traditionally, the citizen armies of the ancient world were supplied by a combination of levies and volunteer troops. Often farmers and landowners, these men ultimately looked to return to their plots and families, comforted by the spoils of war. The professional soldier was a different beast entirely. He gave his life to the army, never wavering to think on what awaited him back home. However, when a state discharged these men without suitable reward, they often turned to their generals. If successful in finding the spoils to offer his men, a general could exert huge influence and power. In 88BC Sulla was the first aggrieved general to march his men towards Rome, an act which led to many marches on the city by power hungry generals, followed by strong and powerful armies."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_philosophy_ritual_sacrifice"	"Ritual sacrifices were often used as a means of atoning for wrongdoing or curing disease. Illness was a punishment from the gods and, by offering an animal in sacrifice, the individual hoped to regain divine favour. Sacrifices in the Mesopotamian culture were often designed to offer meals to the gods, with rituals carried out several times a day in elaborate ceremonies with music, food and incense. The daily menu offered to the Sumerian god, Anu, was said to be vast and included  bulls, rams, lambs and an array of birds."	"True"

Scattered amongst these deserts were oases, which were mainly used as military outposts and stop-overs for merchant caravans. Using a system of canals and reservoirs these oases could be expanded, reclaiming the desert for farming. Fayum, the most prominent oasis in the western desert, was connected to the Nile via the Bahr Yusef canal, and its agriculture thrived.

The origins of astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia with the Sumerians, whose knowledge passed to and was developed by the Babylonians. Their ideas were then accepted by the Greeks, who were responsible for a number of key advances in astronomy, the most impressive of which so far discovered was the 'Antikythera Mechanism'. Found in a shipwreck, this device was an early analogue computer used to track the movement of the planets. Until its discovery in 1900 it was believed the first device of this kind hadn’t been invented until the 14th century."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_ara_civil_economy_canal_and_dam_system"	"Agriculture in the east was often blighted by erratic rainfall in a harsh landscape. Farmers soon realised that irrigation systems, like canals and dams, were ideal for storing and transporting the water they needed for 'dry-farming' in these areas. In Mesopotamia, the Euphrates and Tigris rivers were unpredictable and could often swell after sowing season, flooding the crops. Storage basins were therefore used to collect the surplus water, and a canal system was constructed to distribute it as needed to the fields."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_military_management_marine_training"	"The marines of ancient Greece were paid volunteers who tended to be from the lower citizen classes. This was possibly because they were more likely to be available for naval service and not likely to be called for regular hoplite service. Fighting from the deck of a moving ship required skills that could only be developed through experience, so it is likely that the soldiers employed by Greek navies made their living as marines. Despite their low birth, marines were next to the captain in a ship's hierarchy and took part in ceremonies and political discussions. Thucydides even called the marines of one fleet “the best men” to fall in the Peloponnesian War."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_saba_military_management_camel_tactics"	"Camels have a number of advantages over horses. Although notorious for their questionable temperament, they can be docile when handled correctly and are less nervous than horses. As desert creatures, camels also have greater stamina and can endure long periods without water. This advantage offered a certain strategic flexibility to commanders, as long treks in arid conditions could then be undertaken. When faced with conventional cavalry, the size and odour of camels caused horses to rear-up and back away in a fight. The invention of the Arabian saddle in the 4th century BC made effective control considerably easier; the steady, elevated position of the saddle enabled an archer to scan the battlefield and pick his targets off with some ease."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_num_military_top_supply_foraging"	"When fighting in foreign lands an army lives or dies on its foraging abilities. The ancient Celts were well aware of this fact and made it incredibly difficult for the Romans to gather food during their invasion. Should a careless general send a small party of men out to forage for food the tribes would make sure they were never seen again. After losing several parties this way, Caesar started sending entire Legions to guard his foragers."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_economy_fixed_tarrifs"	"As international trade boomed, so central government increased its intervention in trading matters, having previously allowed merchants much autonomy.

Such measures prevented prices from escalating as a resource, raw material or luxury item made its way across the ever expanding network of trade routes."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_economy_armed_escorts"	"Trade between cities promised huge profits. The nomadic tribes, and later merchants, played a vital role in distributing goods and raw materials. Merchants were given great freedom to conduct their activities but, when rivalry between cities escalated to violence, popular and rich trade routes became targets for tribal bandits. Powerful and wealthy individuals exploited such situations, with caravan chiefs selling protection at extortionate rates.

"technologies_long_description_dk_saba_civil_economy_legal_institutions"	"By introducing a set of laws that were not entirely subject to the whims of the ruler, legal institutions provided a framework of rules that decided how wealth could and should be distributed. Some of the greatest advances made in this area were put forward by a jurist known simply as Gaius. He wrote many great works on the finer points of Roman law but he is best known for his work “The Institutions of Gaius”. It was broken into four sections that discussed how people, things, intestate succession and actions should be governed by law."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_military_management_elephant_trading"	"Capable of striking fear into any opponent, war elephants were first seen on the battlefields of antiquity when Alexander the Great faced Persian elephants at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331BC. Their prowess as shock troops was soon legendary and elephants, particularly the larger, more powerful Indian and Sri Lankan varieties, became a precious commodity. The Mediterranean powers paid handsomely to harness their power, and considerable profit could be made through arranging the passage of consignments of elephants via Asian seaports."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_philosophy_ceremonial_rites"	"The ceremonies and rituals practiced in antiquity were often centred on the important rites of passage in life: birth, marriage and death. Elaborate funerary rites transferred the deceased to the spirit world. For instance, bodies in Mesopotamia were often sealed in ceramic jars, or wrapped in matting, before being buried alongside vessels filled with blood and water, to ensure that their spirits remained well-fed. There is evidence to suggest that these were broken during the ceremony and also that torches were lit around the grave to protect the living from the contamination of the dead."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_num_civil_economy_fertilisation"	"As civilisations became more dependent on a limited area of arable land they were forced to manage soil quality carefully. In the 8th century BC, the Greeks discovered that thrush droppings, when spread across a harvested field, could enrich the soil for the next crop. The Romans, concerned about the small amount of land available around the Mediterranean, became careful masters of their farm plots, practising mixed farming. They used 'fallowing', resting the land between harvests, to allow their animal herds to naturally fertilise the soil. The Roman statesmen, Cato the Elder, listed the most effective fertilisers as “...litter from stables, lupine, chaff, beanstalks, and the leaves of oak and holm-oak”."	"True"

However, with writing skills far from widespread the 'stipulatio', a basic contract between two parties, was agreed orally by both. This form of agreement was the norm in Rome and it took time for written contracts to be accepted. Greek law, on the other hand, had always been based on the principles of written contracts and its influence gradually encouraged the Romans to bind oral contracts within written terms."	"True"

This saw farmers divide fields into three sections and in each, start with a wheat crop, followed by a vegetable or cereal for livestock feed, and finally the land would for a time be left 'fallow', or unused, to replenish its nutrients."

"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_military_management_naval_manoeuvres"	"By the 5th century BC naval battles were changing, as the ship’s ram became the principle weapon, making artful seamanship and carefully timed manoeuvres the key to success. There were a range of recognised tactics, including the 'periplous' - an outflanking manoeuvre - and the 'diekplous' - a more complex movement which was also known as "breaking the line". Here an attacking ship would navigate between two enemy vessels and rely on superior speed and agility to ram the midships or stern of its target. This tactic could be aided by sailing close enough to the enemy to shear off their oars, immobilising them before ramming."	"True"

The Roman army undoubtedly set the standard and demonstrated the gains from their disciplined tactics in numerous battles, not least when faced with war elephants at the Battle of Zama in 202BC.

This was possibly because they were more likely to be available for naval service and not likely to be called for regular hoplite service. Fighting from the deck of a moving ship required skills that could only be developed through experience, so it is likely that the soldiers employed by Greek navies made their living as marines. Despite their low birth, marines were next to the captain in a ship's hierarchy and took part in ceremonies and political discussions.

During the Second Punic War, when Hannibal led his army - including eighteen mighty war elephants - across the Alps to attack Rome on its own territory. Once the Numidians changed sides, the Romans sent advisors to help and train the heavy infantry of their new ally, the Masaesyli king Syphax.

Although a lone elephant could inflict heavy damage on a unit of infantry or a poorly defended gatehouse, the Ghaznavids were not satisfied by this and developed an elaborate ramming device powered by no less than five elephants. This powerful siege weapon was transported by four beasts while a fifth, controlled by a driver, the ‘mahout’, pushed and pulled the iron-tipped ram."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_saba_military_tactics_weapon_proficiency"	"Each army had its own training methods. Nations with hoplite-heavy armies believed dancing and athletics were sufficient to prepare a man for battle. Roman generals took a slightly different view. Legionaries trained with a wooden sword, twice the weight of a battle weapon, against a wooden post. They would train for hours, practising stabs, thrusts and feints against their immobile opponents. This would then progress to fencing practice with other recruits, using swords with covered tips, before the finely-honed weapon skills were taken into full mock battles."	"True"

Although usually used to describe the adoption of Greek law, architecture, military and religious practices, etc. among Alexander the Great's eastern conquests, it can also refer to the gradual absorption of aspects of Hellenic culture by those 'barbarian' tribal societies living on the fringes of the Greek world. At a tribal level, Hellenisation was most prevalent among the noble classes, who aspired to be as 'civilised' as the Greeks. However, many defeats at Greek hands also caused a gradual shift in Nabataean military thinking, which in turn led them to field their own version of the hoplite phalanx and a version of the traditional peltast, a lightly-armoured skirmisher."

"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_nab_military_tactics_ship_pumps"	"Wooden ships routinely sprang leaks and the accumulation of water within a large hull had to be bailed out by hand, a slow and sometimes dangerous task. It was a job made easier by the invention of the force pump. The Greek inventor, Cteisibius of Alexandria, developed the theories about compressed air that made this device possible, earning him the soubriquet “the father of pneumatics”.

"technologies_long_description_dk_saba_civil_philosophy_astronomy"	"The study of the night sky is probably older than civilisation, for the gods lived in the skies. The origins of astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia with the Sumerians, whose knowledge passed to and was developed by the Babylonians. Their ideas were then accepted by the Greeks, who were responsible for a number of key advances in astronomy, the most impressive of which so far discovered was the 'Antikythera Mechanism'.

This term is also applied to many similar curved weapons, such as the scimitar, the Persian shamshir and the Egyptian khopesh. The blade on a shotel differed from that of a shamshir or a kopesh in that it was nearly a full semi-circle, meaning it was a far more awkward weapon to wield. In the hands of an experienced swordsman, however, the shotel's potential to deal death was magnified. Its unique design allowed the user to reach around their opponent's shield, either pulling it away to expose their bodies or going straight for a mortal wound with a single swing; when used against cavalry, the shotel was also used to hook and pull the enemy warrior from their horse."

Kept and slaughtered by the nomadic tribes for their meat, milk, hides and fur, horns, and even dung for fuel, they found a practical use for almost every part of the animal. Goat hide is hard and leathery, making it an ideal material for use as a receptacle for water or wine, plus as a material with which to make rudimentary parchment. Their horns could be drunk from, sharpened into arrowheads, and even fashioned into scale armour for the cavalry who formed the mainstay of steppe armies.

"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_construction_water_sluicing"	"The ancients discovered that the use of water in mining, especially gold mining, eased extraction and washed ore from hillsides. Two main methods were employed, hushing and ground-sluicing. Hushing used large quantities of water, stored in tanks, which was poured down over the deposit. This dislodged sediment, exposed the deposit for easier mining and washed smaller deposits into sluicing boxes where they could be collected. Ground-sluicing achieved similar results but was a more controlled technique. Requiring a constant, steady flow of water, it often involved the redirection of natural streams and rivers. Both techniques left land stripped back to bedrock."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_gen_civil_construction_quarrying"	"Ambitious construction projects, particularly those of monumental proportions, required large amounts of stone. Quarrying provided the solution, with ancient engineers using the natural fault lines found in granite to split blocks from the bedrock. Once such a crack had been found, a large labour force was employed to pound the fault line, in order to weaken the rock further. These men carried sledgehammers made from rounded blocks of dolerite, a substance harder than granite. The process was accelerated further when it was discovered that rock which was heated with fires and then cooled by having water poured on, expanded and contracted. This made it split along any weaknesses such as cracks."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_saba_civil_construction_city_planning"	"As cities changed and developed, consideration needed to be given to layout and design. They began to be built in an ordered fashion, in sectors divided using a common grid system. This formed the basis for the majority of the cities built across the Mediterranean, with the grids divided by fairly narrow thoroughfares. Mostly pedestrian traffic meant there was little need to create bigger routes. Only when the slope or curvature of the land changed, perhaps to accommodate a harbour, would a city plan waver from the established grid network."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_dk_saba_civil_construction_architectural_advances"	"The discovery and improvement of new building materials allowed architects to develop new designs. The construction of the arch and vault opened up new architectural possibilities to compliment the columns that had dominated Hellenistic architecture. While Greek architects were slower to embrace new materials and techniques than their Roman counterparts, architecture advanced significantly between 350BC and 100BC. The three traditional columnar orders – Doric, Ionic and Corinthian - were all adapted to allow for the construction of a variety of new buildings. To a layman, the designs at the top of columns became increasingly 'fussy'."	"True"

Starting out as sparse, open-air venues, on the outskirts of cities, they went on to become huge building complexes at the heart of the community. Wrestling was a popular pursuit, as was 'pankration', a particularly brutal form of boxing. Proceedings within the gymnasia were overseen by the gymnasiarch. It was his responsibility to procure the olive oil that coated the athletes and ensure that sporting standards were kept up, whilst seeing that those who bent the rules were duly punished."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_dk_nab_civil_construction_advanced_construction_techniques"	"As building materials became more understood, and skills developed amongst architects and builders, new construction techniques became possible. Domes, arches and vaults became regular features in Roman architecture, but a true dome was perhaps the pinnacle achievement of architects and builders of the time. They posed complex puzzles when it came to supporting the weight of the structure as it was being built, and it took time and a certain amount of trial and error for architects to perfect the system. The Pantheon in Rome is one of the best examples of a true dome and suggests that by AD128 architects had mastered the form."	"True"

Partly to deal with their lack of training and equipment, and partly to enable more flexible tactics, we have introduced a new, light infantry unit class, carrying light, wicker ‘pelte’ shields, who can hopefully exploit the inflexibility of the traditional hoplite phalanx by harassing its flanks and rear, as well as screening the movements of our heavier troops and skirmishing from range before the melee begins in anger.

We say that enough is enough - war is often morally wrong and therefore forbidden by the gods.

Currently, we don't  see the need to develop a major trade fleet to match those of our wealthy Greek and Etruscan neighbours, as the state takes care of corn imports when there are shortages of food.

This has led to a shortage of slaves and the need for other forms of labour to replace them. For example, children who commit certain crimes can now be given to the people they've offended to redeem themselves through honest toil. A father also has the right to sell his children as a debt-bondage or a form of loan. The arrangement, however, has its shortcomings, as the number of available workers cannot be accurately predicted in advance. Luckily, the gradual reversal of our fortunes in recent times has brought a larger number of slaves, so debt-bondage is starting to become less significant."	"True"

"technologies_long_description_inv_tarchuna_military_strength_light_infantry"	"Armies require manpower, but numbers alone are not sufficient to win battles – skill is essential in these times of strategic and tactical advances. In order to do this, it’s become necessary to muster and mobilise the lower classes to assume a more significant military role. Partly to deal with their lack of training and equipment, and partly to enable more flexible tactics, we have introduced a new, light infantry unit class, who can hopefully exploit the inflexibility of the traditional hoplite phalanx by harassing its flanks and rear, as well as screening the movements of our heavier troops and skirmishing from range before the melee begins in anger. Yes, such work is hard and dangerous, so the promise of improved status back at home is used to incentivise these new troops."	"True"

Other times it can be a lesson to teach provocative minor tribes exactly where there place is in the natural order.

Our leader is expected to be a great warrior, respected by his peers and subordinates - a formidable enemy, feared by peasants and kings alike. He displays strong inclinations towards productive statesmanship, bringing stability, nurturing our traders and developing our industry. Finally, he must be a diplomat of the highest order.

Our own naval ambitions have intensified in recent times; we have a growing strategic interest in curbing the Etruscans' naval supremacy over the Tyrrhenum Sea.

"technologies_long_description_inv_veneti_civil_productivity_imported_etruscan_pottery"	"Several decades ago, there was a shortage of Attic pottery. To satisfy the demand for ceramics, the Etruscans established their own workshops. In a short time, and initially under immigrant potters and painters, a flourishing production line started. Currently, one of the workshops at Falerii produces large scale red-figured vases. Other workshops specialise in smaller drinking vessels and enamelling colours. In Volterra, the highest quality wares are produced, including ceramics in the likeness of metal vessels, as demanded by our aristocrats' thirst for luxury goods. Pottery production is not only for local consumption, however; it is widely distributed throughout most of Italy."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_inv_samnites_military_via_strategematum_the_prescriptions_of_ver_sacrum"	"The rite of ‘Ver sacrum’ requires strict observance of rules and dates, commanding that sacrifices are made dutifully by all those prescribed to carry them out. In the absence of a supervising priest, the most pious among us take charge, being most careful to follow the sacred instructions to the letter lest the opposite effect to the one intended is achieved. Of the many examples of a successful Ver sacrum, the Picentes followed a woodpecker as it migrated down to Asculum from the coast; the Hirpini – also of Samnite blood, like us – followed a wolf from the Sabine Hills. Both groups are now thriving."	"True"

This is a struggle familiar to everyone in the north of Italy. In the long run, however, the Etruscans' dreams can never become reality. Not only we are superior warriors, but we are better equipped to wage war in our home territory.

Our forefathers relied on the fruits from the depths of the earth to fuel their trade relations with the Etruscans and Greeks.

Nowadays, we use this precious knowledge to exploit our own natural resources and to provide labour for our neighbours, should they be willing to remunerate us properly."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_inv_senones_civil_productivity_items_of_trade"	"We are skilful and hardworking people. We proudly rely on our own means and abilities. Unfortunately, there are some products of value and sophistication which we cannot create by ourselves.

In return we supply them with slaves, leather, metals and salt."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_inv_taranto_military_hegemonia_marines_on_land"	"At this time, ships are the fastest transport available, which enables us to prosecute war at a fast pace and carry out surprise lightning strikes on coastal settlements in enemy territory.

"technologies_long_description_inv_tarchuna_civil_productivity_livestock_and_pastures"	"Sheep and goats are valuable sources of milk, cheese, wool and meat, requiring adequate land set aside for grazing and, of course, plenty of water. During Italy's hot summers, such needs are often hard to meet. The purchase and breeding of larger specimens requires capital which not many of our people possess.

Our warriors, patient and calm, hidden in the shadows, blending in with the trees, receive the signal from their chieftain... "Attack!" We are masters of the art of ambush, training constantly, which has brought us victory many times. There are very few survivors and they tell tales of nightmares and unearthly dread!"	"True"
"technologies_long_description_inv_iolei_civil_productivity_animal_husbandry"	"We are one with nature. Our ancestors learned how to breed animals a long time ago. We rear cattle, pigs, sheep and goats for meat, milk, cheese and wool. We also breed horses, which are not only indispensable for work and warfare, but are also greatly admired for their beauty and speed throughout the known world. Our dogs display another set of desirable qualities: good hunters and excellent guards.

As we are deeply connected to the natural world, we spend much time training with our horses – after all, one never knows exactly when the call to battle will come, only that it will. Over time, we’ve developed a saddle to allow us to improve our riding and horseback-fighting skills whilst decreasing the likelihood of falling or being thrown from our horses during combat. Its main innovation is the addition of four pommels which fix the rider in place, allowing him to use his hands to wield a spear, axe or sword.

When on the path of conquest, we rely on the locals to replenish our supplies. What we cannot find, steal or make on the march we must carry from home. This is not due to tradition, but the realities of war in Italy, which make it necessary to develop some level of logistical expertise.

We Greeks are careful around Ares, because he represents our own human imperfections.

The city’s stunning defeat of the Persians at Salamis, almost a century ago, has seen naval power remain at the forefront of Athens’ military rationale, and naval service become part of a citizen’s key responsibilities.

In the furious battle that followed, two of the Romans were killed and all the Albans were wounded. The last Horatii standing, Publius, ran across the battlefield, pursued by the Curiatii who, having different injuries, ran at different speeds.

In order to do this, it’s become necessary to muster and mobilise the lower classes to assume a more significant military role. Partly to deal with their lack of training and equipment, and partly to enable more flexible tactics, we have introduced a new, light infantry unit class, carrying light, wicker ‘pelte’ shields, who can hopefully exploit the inflexibility of the traditional hoplite phalanx by harassing its flanks and rear, as well as screening the movements of our heavier troops and skirmishing from range before the melee begins in anger.

Militarily, we are weaker when a battle takes longer than anticipated. To prepare for such moments, we have developed certain tactical solutions. One of which is the column march, which is most useful when warriors from different tribes fight together; it not only allows every group to fight in its own style, but also creates a competition among us. However, we have found that our enemies are often so weak and unworthy that our inter-tribal battlefield rivalry is more important."	"True"

When new islands are created or seas are unexpectedly calm, that is the work of Poseidon.

Over time, we’ve developed a saddle to allow us to improve our riding and horseback-fighting skills whilst decreasing the likelihood of falling or being thrown from our horses during combat. Its main innovation is the addition of four pommels which fix the rider in place, allowing him to use his hands to wield a spear, axe or sword.

Here in Syracuse we have developed larger artillery pieces specifically for use at sea.

Until now, only two Roman generals have received the spolia opima; the first general was Romulus himself, who fought and killed Acro, king of the neighbouring town of Caenina; the second was Aulus Cornelius Cossus, who received his laurels from the king of Veii.

This miracle device is called a ‘catapult’, and it works very much like a crossbow, but with a much higher firing arc.

Over time, we’ve developed a saddle to allow us to improve our riding and horseback-fighting skills whilst decreasing the likelihood of falling or being thrown from our horses during combat. Its main innovation is the addition of four pommels which fix the rider in place, allowing him to use his hands to wield a spear, axe or sword.

The patricians can trace their origins back to the first families of Rome and have accumulated vast wealth and influence; they also hold a monopoly over public and religious offices. The substantial differences between rich and poor create a specific feature of our society, known as 'patronage', whereby citizens in dire economic trouble rely on the generosity of their wealthier neighbours.

When called for military service, a citizen is obliged to provide their own weapons and armour in accordance with their social class. Romans don't consider the physical well-being of an individual citizen to be their concern. Instead, we rely on our own personal means of defence.

We also use battering rams to persuade stubborn city gates to open up and welcome their new masters.

We call these towers 'nuraghi'. They consist of three components: an outer layer in the shape of a tower; an inner layer made of smaller stones; an intermediate layer of very small pieces and earth to bind them together.

Undoubtedly, such things will be his downfall, assuming he doesn’t fall in battle or to the assassin’s poisoned blade.

Until now, this tradition allowed us to comfortably control our territory. Things change, however, and we must be ready for future challenges and new adversaries. As such, Camillus has introduced a new, more flexible and robust system, which has led to the creation of new unit classes. The young 'hastati', whose weapon is a short spear, stand in the first battle line. Behind them are the experienced 'principes', and further behind, the veteran 'triarii'.

Therefore, political power is, naturally, related to a citizen's position within the army.

Not only are we superior warriors, able to see through their tactics, but we also enjoy divine support; we have heard that the gods have cursed Carthage's armies with a recurring plague and the lowest morale possible. We, on the other hand, are always filled with vigour when fighting such a foe!"	"True"

It is therefore wise to introduce improvements to our supply train; we have invested in horses and mules to replace our old ox-drawn carts.

This way, we can afford to have smaller local storage places along our supply lines, which can be used on demand and easily replenished."	"True"

When on the path of conquest, we rely on the locals to replenish our supplies. What we cannot find, steal or make on the march we must carry from home. Weapons, ammunition, medical supplies, decent wine - even our wives - they all have to be transported to the army by ox-cart. This logistical arrangement may be slow and cumbersome but it works and, most importantly, it is affordable, though it limits our military endeavours to certain seasons.

"technologies_long_description_inv_rome_civil_via_labos_a_regional_market_capital"	"Roma is strategically positioned across several hills at a major crossing of the River Tiber above its flood plain. Such positioning has proved to be a stimulant to the developments of our markets. The salt deposits at the river's mouth and the demand for metals and luxury goods are the main contributors. The fact that, under the current system, our troops are obliged to provide their own armour and weapons, maintains a healthy demand for new weapons and pieces of armour. The slave trade has also gained momentum, meaning that the resultant low or no-cost produce, such as leather, pottery and especially olives, are now major features of the average Roman marketplace as well. Along with the bartering and exchange of goods, bronze has established itself as a medium of exchange. As you might expect, Greek coins have also made an appearance, but such currencies are not yet of interest to us."	"True"

Prolonged lack of action or several successive defeats will trigger a strong sense of dissatisfaction within the proud soul of each and every warrior.

We keep in her favour through an elaborate cycle of religious festivals regarding all aspects of crop production. We also sacrifice a pig to Ceres before sowing the seeds in the spring.

Undoubtedly, such things will be his downfall, assuming he doesn’t fall in battle or to the assassin’s poisoned blade.

Therefore, political power is, naturally, related to a citizen's position within the army.

To keep our grain dry at this time we use kilns, for which we dig huge pits and prepare covers from wood, weighted down by stone. Then, before storing them, we heat up the kernels of the grain with fire, which makes them impervious to moisture. This method allows grain to be preserved for prolonged periods of time.

Eubulus, the comic poet – a contemporary of ours – described the toasting process thusly: “Three bowls do I mix for the temperate: one to health, which they empty first; the second to love and pleasure; the third to sleep. When this bowl is drunk up, wise guests go home. The fourth bowl is ours no longer, but belongs to violence; the fifth to uproar; the sixth to drunken revel; the seventh to black eyes; the eighth is the policeman’s; the ninth belongs to biliousness; and the tenth to madness and the hurling of furniture.” Never a truer word said!"

Dionysius, the Tyrant of Syracuse, has invented a device to hurl projectiles over great distances, with considerable force, in order to smash into, and hopefully knock down, the walls of besieged enemy settlements. This miracle device is called a ‘catapult’, and it works very much like a crossbow, but with a much higher firing arc.

We are working to reinforce our ships' prows in order to withstand and absorb the impact of a ramming action without impeding their performance."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_inv_senones_military_strategy_vae_victis"	"There are several large, wealthy cities in Italy – rich in culture but, more importantly, filled with treasure and ripe for the taking. Let’s start with Roma; one would think their city was made of silver and gold, so precious are the Romans about their home. Then there are the arrogant, haughty Etruscans – Veii and Tarchuna have long been beacons of Etruscan culture, but their flame is dying now and we will ensure it is extinguished for good! Neapolis, further south, is a purely-Greek pearl on the Italian coast – as we all know, pearls should be harvested, not left to die with their oysters. To capture or sack any of these grand prizes will bring us not only booty, but slave workers that we can exploit for our own gain. Such victories will elevate us above our peers and rivals – we will be respected and feared in equal measure."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_inv_rome_military_via_strategematum_catapulta_diversitas"	"Building on the blueprint of Dionysius’ catapult, we have developed two new variations which better suit our military needs. The first is the double-armed ballista, a sort of large crossbow, which when finished will be able to shoot large arrows designed to skewer entire units. The second is a single-armed catapult for hurling rocks. This diversity provides us with yet another tool for achieving our military goals. The catapult is changing the way war is fought and we will be ready, at the vanguard of conflict, to take advantage of this excellent new development."	"True"

His father gifted Asclepius with the secrets of medicine and the power to heal, and his cult enjoys great popularity among the people. At Asclepius’ temple, medicine, utilising plants and herbs, is practised; it heals a range of conditions, from simple headaches and insomnia to something as serious as acute epilepsy. Advice regarding non-medical matters is also offered at the temple by the worldly and well-respected priesthood. Sensational successes have been claimed in all areas to be evidence of Asclepius’ divine intervention. What reason could there be to doubt such a benevolent deity\?

To have his patronage is essential in a society that consumes as much wine as we do! Eubulus, the comic poet – a contemporary of ours – described the toasting process thusly: “Three bowls do I mix for the temperate: one to health, which they empty first; the second to love and pleasure; the third to sleep. When this bowl is drunk up, wise guests go home. The fourth bowl is ours no longer, but belongs to violence; the fifth to uproar; the sixth to drunken revel; the seventh to black eyes; the eighth is the policeman’s; the ninth belongs to biliousness; and the tenth to madness and the hurling of furniture.” Never a truer word said!"

"True"
"technologies_long_description_inv_tarchuna_military_strategy_military_engineering"	"There’s far more to victory in war than simply fielding a larger army with better soldiers than your opponents’ – a good command of strategy and, on the battlefield level, tactics is key to success, and that’s something that may require years of careful planning prior to the actual fighting: where to fight and precisely when. Of course, it’s also important to get the preparation right, so the correct training and drill, on suitable ground and of the correct units, is essential too. It’s also a matter of military engineering (war is as much about defence as attack), so advanced construction skills are needed to prepare city walls and other defensive structures must be of the highest quality, lest a conflict doesn’t go our way or the enemy somehow manage to besiege our possessions whilst our army is away on campaign."

"technologies_long_description_inv_senones_civil_productivity_improved_hoe"	"We are familiar with iron and its many applications. In farming, we made our hoes with iron blades instead of wood. This allowed us to better and much more easily shape and clear the soil and harvest the crops. The tool requires some expertise to achieve good results but a few seasons on the field are usually sufficient for this to accrue. However, such work is hard and often leads to serious injuries of the back and the limbs. Nevertheless, the improvement helps us to increase production and slightly lower the burden of our daily work."	"True"

We have long been using iron to forge weapons, but bronze remains our preference. Nowadays, despite its brittle nature and variable quality, iron is cheaper and more abundant. We can outfit larger armies for less, and with better quality equipment overall. Iron is good for everything, be they spears, arrow heads, swords and armour; its wide number of practical applications will change the nature of warfare forever."	"True"
"technologies_long_description_inv_rome_civil_via_vitae_adapt_and_adopt"	"We Romans are well aware of our mixed origins and see it as a virtue that our ancestors were willing to admit foreigners into their midst. Many immigrant families reached public office, serving as magistrates. Many of our early consuls were of Etruscan origin, which proves that even though the monarchy unravelled following the removal of our final Etruscan king, this didn't affect the well-being of those citizens of Etruscan origin.

She gave us the 'Libri Fulgurales', which tought us how to interpret the lightning sent by the gods. She also provided us with the knowledge to map the sky from the liver of a sacrificed animal; divisions observed in the sky and the liver tell us how our lands should be acquired and distributed.

"technologies_long_description_inv_rome_civil_via_vitae_unite_the_latins"	"Our Latin cousins have always meant a lot to us - more than a century ago we signed a sacred treaty of non-aggression. Set up by a consul at the time, Spurius Cassius, it is known as the 'Foedus Cassianum'. Its terms are inscribed on a bronze pillar installed in the Forum to this day. The treaty lays down terms for perpetual peace between us and a defensive military alliance against threats from without. Nowadays, however, former loyalties seem to be melting and strategic interests shifting. Although the trust between us has diminished, we don't yet consider it cause for concern - we are confident that when the time is right, the gods will push us closer together again."	"True"

He holds the firm conviction that education beyond the conventions of ‘mousike’ (intellectual) and ‘gymnastike’ (physical) is necessary to prepare the young for the demands of the modern world. He rejects the pursuit of reward, as morality itself should be education’s only goal. His students, therefore, are expected to pursue moral fortitude for its own sake."	"True"
