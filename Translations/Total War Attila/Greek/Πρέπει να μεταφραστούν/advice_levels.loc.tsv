Be wary though, as other migrating tribes may be pursuing the same goal.

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139657866"	"As an alternative to straight-forward occupation, upon capture of a settlement there is also an option to loot it. Doing so adds a lump sum to your treasury, but there will be a greater public order penalty than that caused by occupation alone."	"True"

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665365"	"Capture points inside a besieged settlement, such as gates, towers and plazas, give different advantages to the army controlling them. In order to take control of such positions units must stand next to them until the enemy’s banner is lowered and their own faction’s is raised.

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665355"	"Cheap to maintain and speedy in their terrible work, raiders can be used to set fire to besieged settlements. However, they must be closely watched, as they are impetuous and unruly and may act without orders.

Be mindful too of your southeastern territories; the Sassanid Empire is strong and will challenge you for dominion of the east.

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139664941"	"The south is in turmoil, distracted by petty conflict and the westward migration of the Huns. Therefore, you should look elsewhere for opportunities. Rome has all but lost its grip on Britannia, ever threatened by Celtic aggression, so you should have no trouble establishing a presence there. A long cold creeping from the north is also driving its men into action; they are formidable warriors and could pose a great threat should they raid or attempt to conquer the mainland. Better, perhaps, to take the fight to them instead. Fight, win and prevail, so the Saxons can carve their place in the annals of history!"	"True"

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666338"	"Though hardship certainly awaits, you are poised to create a civilised Slavic identity that will endure the test of time. Your people are the children of the steppes, destined to inherit all of Europe!"	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666303"	"Centuries ago, Rome came to our doorstep, displacing our neighbours and snapping at our heels. Though we have exchanged some pleasantries since then, they nevertheless exist where they should not."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666102"	"The world waits for you, Charlemagne. Unify your people behind your banner and the Frankish Kingdom will know no earthly borders!"	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666202"	"To the south, your Saxon allies are threatened by the nomadic Slavs. If you push them back now, you may gain the security you need to expand."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666008"	"Subjugating both will secure your borders, yet Northumbria poses your greatest threat. It threatens to overthrow the Picts and become a powerful enemy - the only answer is its  absorption into your own realm."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666108"	"You have fought to preserve every inch of this land from the Islamic invaders, but cannot hide behind the Cantabrian Mountains forever. Beyond, the Umayyads persist."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666212"	"Across the western sea is the isle of Britain, thrown into disarray after centuries of occupation and unrest. Its people squabble amongst themselves, and are ill-prepared for your fury."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666312"	"However, their control is wavering. To the north, the Huns and barbarians demand their attention, which leaves their African holdings vulnerable. We could make great gains here and reclaim the coast."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666110"	"Yet there is hope. To the east, the governors of Pamplona, Zaragoza and Barcelona have defied the Umayyads and rebelled against their cruelty. Their dissent is weakness in the otherwise-formidable Umayyad forces, so capturing their lands could give you much-needed strength in the struggle to come!"	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666215"	"South of them, on the mainland, is the Kingdom of the Franks. Though currently fractured, it would be powerful if united under a single ruler. There is wisdom in attacking whilst it is at its weakest."	"True"

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666018"	"Across the waves, Ireland offers promising territory but should be approached with caution - its people are unruly and more than a little dangerous."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666263"	"The lands they have ravaged have been all but abandoned - we could be the ones to recolonise them. The soil is barren and burned, but we Slavs are masters of the land, able to nurture any earth back to fertility."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666262"	"The Huns are upon us. They have descended from the steppes with the changing climate, and destroying all in their path. They will soon turn their savage eyes to us, yet hope is not lost; there is wisdom, perhaps, in treating peacefully with them, and purchasing our safety in the process."	"True"

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665964"	"For many centuries your empire has flourished away from civilisation as the last great African kingdom. Now, however, the value of the Indian spice route has been truly realised, thrusting you into the limelight at last. Predictably, Rome courts you as an ally, pointing to your shared Christianity and the looming threat of the Himyarites across the water. You may rely on Roman support to cross the Red Sea and monopolise trade with the east, or you may reject their advances, turning back to the pagan routes that once sustained your kingdom. Perhaps then you could unite with other kingdoms in the region to drive the Romans from African shores once and for all. Your choice will shape your kingdom - make it well!"	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665969"	"You are the lords of the Arabian Peninsula - inheritors of a proud tradition of Arabic kingdoms. Whereas once you vied for control of the lucrative eastern trade ports, eventually your martial supremacy bent others to your will and created a kingdom combining only the very best elements of centuries of development. Across the water a threat to your kingdom blossoms – the newly-Christian Aksumite Empire has lately become aggressive, and their friendship with Rome goes from strength to strength. Ensure their designs on your territory do not become a reality by striking first! Once they are subdued, think carefully about your state religion; will you return to the roots of your ancestors, or uphold the Jewish faith to become a new, chosen people\?"	"True"

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666073"	"Your ancestors made the Franks powerful, Charlemagne, but you inherit a kingdom divided."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666173"	"To the west, the Franks are concerned with their own civil strife, but they will not be distracted forever and will turn their swords against any who do not worship their one god."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666276"	"The Huns are everywhere - marauding and raiding - but we say let them come! Though they are numerous, we are a strong and determined people. We will not bow to the hordes."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666074"	"Your brother, Carloman, rules half of your empire - as willed by your father - yet the kingdom would be better served under a single ruler. Do what you must to ensure that you are that ruler, and righteously so."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665979"	"Thrice the Romans have denied you. They sit in Constantinople, forgetting that the blood of our people once soaked those very walls in their defence. The Goths, now, are their playthings, while we rot in the desert. But no longer! Queen Mavia has rallied the tribe and now charges you with building upon the success of your rebellions so far. Sow fire and destruction from Egypt to Constantinople, and show them just how deadly a mistake they have made! This time, there will be no peaceful resolution! With each victory our power will grow, others will flock to your banner until the whole east rises as one as part of a new, Tanukhid Empire!"	"True"

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665978"	"Although a new kingdom, your capital city, Hira, is renowned for its beauty, lauded as a wonder of Arabic culture, causing many tribes to unashamedly place themselves under your protection. The Sassanids, once your sworn foe, now count you as their most powerful strategic assets, no doubt due to your proximity to the Roman border. Only Rome’s Ghassanid allies prevent you from capturing the fertile settlements of the Mediterranean coast, and so must be dispatched as soon as possible. Seize these lands on the Sassanids’ behalf and consider converting to Zoroastrianism. Alternatively, take advantage of Persian haughtiness, exploiting the rift caused by your recent conversion to Christianity to break free from your overlords and forge an independent superpower of your own!"	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666278"	"Elsewhere, the world is weak and vulnerable in the face of this Hunnic threat. The Roman Empire, to the south, has too few armies to defend all its vast holdings. There is opportunity here, and territory to be gained."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666140"	"Since the old Frankish king - Pepin the Short - died, you have been able to raid his lands with relative impunity. However, that may soon change, so your people are in need of a powerful leader of their own."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666246"	"The Romans, to the south, are the pinnacle of civilisation. A favourable relationship with them will further our cause - we are much more than the simple, forest-dwelling 'savages' they think we are."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666145"	"Although the Franks pose a threat when united, they are currently divided against one another; a situation that you should take advantage of."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666249"	"Yet do not forget your people's roots. We are resourceful and skilled in agriculture - even the most barren and mistreated soil prospers under our watchful care."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666048"	"Furthermore, the Papal States grow bold and impetuous, bolstered by their alliance with the Franks. They occupy precious Italian land and so must serve your interests first, one way or another."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666153"	"Over in the east, the Slavs pose a more unified threat. Allied with the Franks, they would gladly see your territories conquered in their name. Strike first, and take their lands for yourself."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666252"	"To the east, the Huns ravage the land, whilst to the west Europe buckles under the pressure; opportunity awaits in the broken territory of the old world."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666157"	"To the north, your Danish allies stand steadfast. They share your religion and together you could turn back the insipid tide of Christianity that sweeps Europe."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666159"	"The menace of the one god descends from the skies; he comes to sweep away the many gods - of earth and stream. Your people, alone, have the strength to stop his advance. Take up arms in your ancestors' name!"	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666259"	"The Venedians are the great fathers of the Slavs, and instigators of their great expansion across eastern Europe. Yet great dangers threaten all we have accomplished - dangers we must face if we are to survive."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666058"	"Further south, the Theme of Sicily push the Byzantine agenda, foolishly desiring to reclaim the lost Roman Empire. Watch events here carefully."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666082"	"Bavaria and the Lombards may make valuable allies, should war with your brother become inevitable, but do not rely on these fair-weather "friends""" for long."""	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665981"	"Fifty years have passed since you liberated Al-Andalus, and 146 since the great journey of the Prophet – peace be upon him.  You are all that remains of the Umayyad Caliphate, driven from your ancestral home by the perfidious Abbasids. Yet here, in Al-Andalus, the Caliphate has been reborn in the west, as a centre of beauty and culture."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666280"	"Be bold, but careful. Rome may be vulnerable, but they still have allies - enemies who would see us fail if they could. These cowards flee their homes and look voraciously upon ours."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666087"	"Your father was the Pope's firm ally. If he calls, the Franks will answer with help. Lombardian ire will be inevitable - old wounds leave permanent scars, but this should mean nothing to you."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666186"	"Italy lies to the southwest, across the Po valley, and beyond the Alps, Germania and Francia. Fearsome challenges, but you can rise to them. You must - Avar survival depends upon it."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666189"	"Destiny awaits beyond your proud borders, Khagan - reach out and grasp it!"	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666289"	"We will not be threatened, or moved. Ours is the land of the Slavs, and though the world may be ablaze in chaos, we do not feel the flames. Those who challenge the Sclavenians will burn!"	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665990"	"However, there are those who would yet try to undo you; in the northwest, the Christian Asturians, who resist you from beyond the Cantabrian Mountains. Destroy them, and consolidate your power over the Spanish Peninsula."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665997"	"Al-Andalus stands on the brink of total Muslim domination - beyond is Europe and the rest of the world. Press on, Emir, and forge the Caliphate anew - that it may last for all eternity!"	"True"

"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139666195"	"Your people have lived and worshipped in these lands for centuries, but now it is time to expand to foreign shores to make your kingdom rich. First, however, you must secure your borders."	"True"
"advice_levels_onscreen_text_2139665994"	"To the northeast are the Franks, who stopped Islam's advance once before. Topple them and all Europe would swiftly fall before your armies."	"True"
